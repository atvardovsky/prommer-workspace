# Alatyr Debug Evidence

This directory stores optional, non-canonical observability evidence for
explicitly selected Alatyr-assisted tasks in `prommer.net workspace`.

Owner: `repository maintainers`
Storage mode: `repository-internal`
Visibility: `repository maintainers`
Retention policy: `retain finalized records until superseded or removed by a maintainer`
Redaction policy: `exclude prompts transcripts timing details drafts private reasoning credentials and non-product contextual metadata`
External patch policy: `exclude-from-external-patch`

Debug records answer how the executor, Alatyr system behavior, automation, and
human supervision contributed to a task. They do not own architecture,
business rules, code contracts, approvals, or validation facts. Route accepted
findings to their canonical project owner and link that owner or durable
engineering-evidence record from the debug record.
Each new event records its decision effect and structured architectural
impacts. A direction-changing correction is linked to the rejected hypothesis
and replacement invariant or architecture direction that followed it.

New records keep actor role, target-local identity, and provider/product/model/
runtime provenance separate. Human and external-maintainer interventions also
classify whether feedback is a new guidance candidate, a known-guidance routing
or compliance failure, task-local, a scope change, or a validation request.
Known-guidance failures name the guidance IDs and evidence involved. Debug
evidence never promotes a candidate or resolves authority by itself.

Values in `final_result.engineering_evidence_ids` must be durable evidence IDs
that resolve exactly once in `.ai/project/engineering-evidence/index.json`.
Debug event IDs are not durable evidence IDs; leave the list empty until a
durable record exists.

Debug Mode is inactive unless the user explicitly enables it for the current
task or session. Activation expires when that logical scope completes, changes,
is abandoned, or is explicitly disabled.

Use `index.json` for compact cross-task lookup. Load only the selected record
under `records/` when detailed evidence is needed. Never store raw
conversations, chain-of-thought, prompts, credentials, secrets, unrelated
personal data, complete diffs, or verbose logs here.
