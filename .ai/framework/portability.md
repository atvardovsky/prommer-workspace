# Alatyr Core Portability Boundary

This file defines which AI-governance facts are portable framework core and
which facts are repository adapter details.

## Portable Framework Core

Portable framework core may describe reusable assistant operating patterns:

- framework, project, and repository adapter contour separation
- required core profile and optional module profile concepts
- context discovery, source-of-truth decision, and missing-context handling
- architecture discussion and approval workflow shape
- documentation-sync workflow shape
- semantic change and logical integrity review workflow shape
- change-risk classes and protected approval trigger categories
- security/safety reasoning categories for secrets, live services,
  destructive operations, permissions, dependencies, and privacy
- stack-aware testing analysis concepts
- gate and final-evidence categories
- prompt, skill, and bridge-file wrapper patterns
- AI infrastructure inventory, skill provenance, adaptation, and third-party
  assistant infrastructure review concepts
- AI infrastructure router/item contract and adaptation-record shape
- diagram-as-code, visual-artifact synchronization, capability-checked
  discussion presentation, and portable ASCII concepts
- consistency-manifest concept
- changed-fact relationship-map shape and impact-closure reasoning
- blueprint-driven product-change workflow concepts
- installed-adapter operation, blueprint creation, framework update recheck,
  and adapter audit concepts
- operation catalog, checked compact alias index, single-entry routing,
  read-only health, pre-change preview, bounded help, and assistant chat-completion
  message concepts
- framework core versus target project adapter installation planning
- adapter maturity levels and framework lifecycle/upgrade concepts
- module-profile concepts for target-specific capability selection
- passive dependency knowledge export, exact artifact binding, target
  projection, bounded graph synchronization, independent semantic state, and
  lazy routing concepts
- user-owned workspace identity and development-mode concepts, artifact
  relationships, optional shared root context, per-mode support directories,
  bounded selection, and non-authorizing preflight

Portable framework core must stay Markdown-first and assistant-neutral.

## Not Framework Core

Portable framework core must not depend on source-repository or environment details,
including:

- concrete package-manager, test, build, script, CI job, or local hook
  commands from one repository
- source-repository checker scripts or generated-file tools as required
  framework mechanisms
- source project business facts, architecture facts, data models, diagrams,
  rejection criteria, or production assumptions
- language, framework, database, queue, or cloud-provider choices from the
  source repository
- source-repository test commands, test folders, fixture helpers, CI jobs, or
  framework-specific testing tools
- source repository bridge text that names project-specific files as target
  facts
- source-repository skill files, prompt wrappers, assistant-native formats,
  tool permissions, or third-party assistant infrastructure as required
  mechanisms
- source-repository security policy, live-service allowlists, dependency
  scanners, secret names, incident procedures, or destructive-command rules
- source-repository diagram formats, render commands, generated-file paths, or
  visual artifact tooling as required mechanisms
- source-repository assistant client rendering or attachment behavior as a
  portable capability claim
- source-repository framework versioning format, release notes, or local
  adapter owner names
- source-repository post-install request templates, audit schedules, or adapter
  reports as required mechanisms
- source-repository operation names, command aliases, help wording, or chat
  completion text as target facts

Those facts are project or repository adapter details.

## Repository Adapter

A repository adapter owns the concrete facts for one project:

- project-specific blueprint, business logic, data model, diagrams, and docs
- target project commands, tests, CI checks, local scripts, hooks, and
  generated-file tools
- target context discovery map, source-of-truth map, risk model, approvals,
  and security/live-service policies
- target diagram formats, visual artifacts, render or manual-review process,
  drift checks, per-assistant rich-presentation capability, and ASCII baseline
- target assistant bridge files selected for the assistants the project uses
- target AI infrastructure inventory, source access, provenance, adaptation,
  wrapper, permission, and evidence rules
- target AI item IDs, triggers, canonical sources, permissions, gates,
  validation, output contracts, conflicts, and adaptation records
- target consistency checks that are deterministic and maintainable in that
  repository
- target fact IDs, relationship edges, project-area mappings, and staleness
  checks
- target adapter maturity gaps, framework baseline, local deviations, and
  lifecycle notes
- target installed-operation requests, blueprint creation/recheck flows, audit
  reports, allowed-action request bounds, and maintenance cadence
- target operation catalog/index, help, routing/health/preview flows, supported local
  request aliases, and
  post-install/update assistant chat-message templates
- target final-evidence requirements for commands that actually exist there
- target package-manager sources, dependency knowledge policy, accepted
  package instances, local patches and deviations, retention decisions,
  applicability conditions, and dependency knowledge validation
- target workspace identity, accepted mode definitions, root/mode supporting
  context, relationship evidence, selection policy, defaults, and mode owners

Each project using Alatyr Core has its own adapter and local gates. Those
local gates can verify that repository, but they must not be copied as
portable framework requirements for another project.

## Installation Rule

When installing or upgrading the assistant framework in another repository:

1. Copy or adapt only the framework structure and wording that is portable.
2. Rewrite every project adapter file from target repository facts.
3. Replace source-repository commands with a target validation plan discovered
   from the target repository.
4. Mark unknown validation as manual or unresolved; do not invent commands.
5. Rewrite target context, risk, security, diagram, maturity, and lifecycle
   facts from target repository evidence.
6. Do not add an installer script as the framework mechanism.

If a source artifact mixes portable framework rules with repository adapter
details, split or rewrite it before using it as framework core.
