# Scaffolding

Scaffolding is an optional helper step that can create placeholder directories
and files before an assistant performs the real installation work.

Scaffolding is not installation. It does not inspect target facts, choose
project source-of-truth owners, approve overwrites, fill placeholders, or
claim the adapter is usable.

## Allowed Scaffolder Behavior

A safe scaffolder may:

- create missing directories
- copy placeholder target templates
- copy portable framework documents and `framework/rule-registry.json` into
  `.ai/framework`
- create an empty or placeholder manifest
- run in dry-run mode
- refuse to overwrite existing files by default
- report skipped files and protected surfaces

Before a writable run, the scaffolder must resolve the complete composition
and detect every known overwrite or shared-surface blocker. If preflight finds
a blocker, it must not write a partial scaffold. A write run that cannot
produce every selected output must fail even when some earlier outputs were
already unchanged or successfully projected.

## Forbidden Scaffolder Behavior

A scaffolder must not:

- fill project facts from guesses
- overwrite existing target instructions without explicit approval
- change product code, tests, runtime config, CI, secrets, or dependencies
- import third-party AI infrastructure into canonical target files
- claim installation is complete
- replace target repository inspection, readiness review, installation plan,
  approval gates, logical integrity review, or final evidence

## Source Repository Helper

The AlatyrCore source repository may include helper scripts for maintainers,
such as `tools/scaffold_target_structure.py`.

Those helpers validate or scaffold source templates. They are not portable
framework requirements and must not be copied into target repositories as
required validation or installation commands.

Source conformance helpers may materialize temporary fixture repositories to
check scaffolder behavior. Such checks validate source templates and helper
behavior only; they are not assistant installation tests and do not prove a
target adapter is complete.

Source helpers should be platform-neutral when practical. The canonical
scaffolder is Python standard-library code and may provide thin launch wrappers
for Windows shells. Wrapper files must delegate to the canonical helper and
must not duplicate installation logic.

A source scaffolder may expose bounded support profiles when their contents are
deterministic and machine-checked:

- `kernel`: minimal adapter, bootstrap, routing, ownership, integrity,
  authorization, generated entry packet, support-state, and final-evidence
  surfaces
- `core`: kernel plus durable engineering evidence, project knowledge,
  change-impact, and common documentation support surfaces
- `standard`: core plus common blueprint, recheck, help, and lifecycle
  operation surfaces
- `full`: the `standard` target support surface with the complete portable
  framework pack; optional modules remain explicit, and native assistant
  bridges still require reviewed surface selection

Exhaustive materialization of every target template is a source conformance
purpose, not an installation profile. Source tooling may select that purpose
for isolated fixtures, but a target installation must not use it as evidence
that every optional capability is enabled or maintained.
The target-facing CLI must reject writable conformance projection.

The selected scaffold support profile limits target placeholder files. A
matching portable framework pack may also limit the copied framework corpus:

- `kernel` support maps to the `kernel` framework pack
- `core` support maps to the `core` framework pack
- `standard` support maps to the `standard` framework pack
- `full` support maps to the `complete` framework pack

A broader framework pack is allowed; a smaller pack than the support profile
is not. Selective packs must preserve rule dependency closure and carry
projected rule-registry, ownership, and file-inventory surfaces. Pack selection
does not enable modules, choose supported assistants, resolve target facts, or
prove installation maturity. Enabling a module whose rule owner is absent
requires an explicit pack expansion and normal framework-update evidence.

Installation and update planning should start from the cheapest sufficient
profile. Use `kernel` unless target evidence names a needed capability,
operation surface, native bridge, or validation failure that requires `core`,
`standard`, or `full`. The compact bootstrap records the selected profile;
the generated recovery entry packet records its escalation reason without
becoming routine model context.

Selecting an assistant-native surface must also select the portable bridge
and installed-operation support needed by that surface. It must not implicitly
enable unrelated optional modules. Every rendered bridge and help surface must
refer only to installed paths; optional references require projection guards.

## Final Evidence

If scaffolding was used, installation evidence should report:

- helper name and mode
- selected scaffold profile
- generated entry-packet freshness
- selected framework pack and projected inventory
- target path
- files created
- files skipped because they already existed
- whether any overwrite approval was used
- remaining placeholders
- confirmation that target facts still need assistant and human review
