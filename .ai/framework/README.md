# Alatyr Core Framework

This directory defines the portable Alatyr Core assistant framework.

It is the reusable source that an assistant can adapt into a target project.
It is separate from any target project's product facts and from any target
repository's local AI adapter.

The framework exists to make assistants work predictably on a project by
forcing context discovery, ownership separation, approval gates, documentation
sync, logical integrity review, and final evidence.

## Owns

  delivery, with direct decision-owner and reviewed-discovery origins,
  canonical owner verification, target-owned exception semantics, coverage
  gaps, independent authority/freshness state, contradiction handling, and
  bounded cross-assistant packets
  (installed owner: `.ai/framework/project-knowledge.md`)
- optional task-local Debug Mode for evidence-based separation of executor,
  Alatyr-system, automation, and human contributions, correction disposition,
  causal follow-up, timing, and rework
- optional large-task orchestration with bounded workstreams, context receipts,
  resumable checkpoints, and final convergence

  task graphs, bounded context, executor selection, and primary-agent
  convergence before non-trivial execution

  prompts, deterministic task/packet/result contracts, verified per-surface
  native/model bindings, write isolation, fallback, and primary convergence

  improving, consolidating, replacing, retiring, and keeping existing items

  retention/privacy boundaries, and no target-to-framework policy promotion
- installed-adapter operation and recheck guidance
- one conversational operation entry, canonical operation catalog, checked
  compact alias index, automatic routing, read-only adapter health, and
  risk-gated pre-change preview
- reusable assistant workflow categories

  concepts

  generated-reference documentation
- optional project-owned vocabulary with scoped terms, aliases, acronyms,
  ambiguity states, and canonical data links

- optional target-adapted test-first development with explicit enablement,
  bounded recommendation, RED/GREEN/refactor evidence, and justified exceptions
- optional declarative extension packages with immutable provenance, target
  bindings, permission review, installed-file ownership, and lifecycle locks
- optional passive dependency knowledge exports with exact artifact binding,
  target-owned semantic state, bounded synchronization, deviations, retention,
  lazy explanation, and impact routing

  artifact relationships, shared root context, per-mode support directories,
  evidence-based suggestions, ambiguity handling, and task preflight
- supported-assistant bridge pattern
- bridge capability matrix plus compact per-surface capability projection

## Does Not Own

- target project business logic, data model, architecture, diagrams, or
  runtime flows
- local commands, CI job names, generated files, hooks, or checker scripts
- project-specific skills, prompts, gates, or bridge wording
- target project facts during installation into another repository

Those belong to a project contour or repository adapter.

## Target Repository Adapter

In a target repository, `.ai/assistant` is normally the repository adapter. It
applies Alatyr Core to that project through local flows, gates, prompts,
skills, bridge files, consistency manifests, and local validation commands or
manual checks.

Portable framework files may point to adapter concepts, but must not require
Alatyr Core's source repository commands or any source project facts.
