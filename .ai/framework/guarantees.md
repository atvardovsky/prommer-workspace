# AI Framework Guarantees And Limits

The framework defines process commitments. Markdown instructions alone cannot
technically force an assistant to read every file, understand every rule, or
perform a flawless logical integrity review.

Use this document to distinguish declarative process commitments,
machine-checkable expectations, target-dependent guarantees, and
non-guarantees.

## Declarative Process Commitments

The framework commits to giving an assistant a defined process for:

- finding task-specific project context before editing
- separating portable framework rules, project facts, and repository adapter
  rules
- discovering missing context and choosing source-of-truth owners or registry
  entries before repairing drift
- classifying changed facts by risk before choosing approval, test,
  documentation, diagram, and evidence scope
- applying portable security and safety reasoning before secrets, live
  services, dependencies, destructive operations, or permissions are changed
- detecting whether a semantic or logical fact changed
- performing logical integrity review before claiming consistency
- re-deriving testable invariants and reconciling related review items before
  accepting a combined repair set
- mapping changed facts to affected docs, diagrams, tests, gates, prompts, and
  skills
- traversing adapted fact relationships to bound multi-level impact review in
  large repositories
- classifying and hashing target support surfaces with cross-platform text
  normalization, then routing only changed support and accepted relationships
  into semantic review
- preserving newly detected relationships as non-authoritative candidates
  until a target decision owner accepts or rejects them
- carrying accepted product changes through blueprint-equivalent docs, flows,
  implementation, validation, diagrams, and final evidence
- coordinating large or resumable changes through bounded workstreams,
  context receipts, checkpoints, and final convergence evidence
- binding activated material changes into optional change packages with
  semantic scope, companion decisions, implementation corrections, and
  repository provenance
- deciding proportionally whether reusable engineering knowledge would be lost
  after a material task, then preserving compact project-owned invariant,
  hypothesis outcome, root-cause, solution, regression, validation, and
  repository-binding evidence or reporting a specific skip or blocker
- coordinating enabled team work through target-owned actors and authority,
  changed-fact-first overlap checks, bounded handoffs, and revision-bound
  review evidence
- analyzing the target stack and risk profile before recommending test levels
  or structure
- reasoning about diagram source/visual synchronization without hard-coding a
  universal diagram tool
- routing diagram discussion through a target-owned presentation contract with
  security/privacy handling, stable revision lineage, compact current-surface
  capability evidence, and a portable ASCII baseline
- routing architecture inventory, explanation, pattern discussion, comparison,
  review, and documentation through a compact project-owned catalog while
  separating observed, intended, proposed, and contradicted architecture
- requiring explicit programmer approval for protected changes
- binding inspect, modify, commit, publish, and live-external phases to the
  newest user intent in one current logical scope, without carrying prior
  phase authorization into a completed or redirected task
- keeping architecture discussion separate from architecture mutation
- keeping documentation and diagrams synchronized with code and project facts
- selecting bounded target-owned code-documentation profiles and generating
  derived reference output when the optional module is enabled
- resolving project terms, aliases, acronyms, and scoped meanings from compact
  target-owned vocabulary records when the optional module is enabled
- recommending, configuring, and applying target-owned test-first policy when
  bounded triggers activate the optional module
- inspecting, normalizing, locking, updating, disabling, and removing
  declarative external extensions when the optional target module is enabled
- recording what was checked, what changed, what was skipped, and what risk
  remains
- qualifying human attention, review cycles, classified interventions, and
  observable executor-active time with explicit observed, manual, estimated,
  or unavailable evidence states instead of treating missing measurements as
  zero
- recording later acceptance, pull-request, merge, rejection, regression,
  revert, or follow-up outcomes as new linked evidence without mutating a
  completed Debug record
- measuring bounded adapter-maintenance effort separately from project-change
  effort through files touched, manual corrections, stale claims, routing
  changes, validation time, and local deviations
- adapting the same process across supported assistants through thin bridge
  files and wrappers
- recording bridge capability differences when supported assistant behavior can
  diverge
- ordering reusable semantic definitions before task-specific context so a
  provider or client may reuse stable prefixes when its reviewed capability
  supports caching, while preserving bounded context routing as the mandatory
  fallback
- adapting skills, prompts, wrappers, and third-party assistant infrastructure
  without letting them bypass framework or target adapter rules
- inventorying existing AI infrastructure before adding, replacing, or
  importing new assistant infrastructure
- recommending new AI infrastructure or changes to existing items only from
  bounded project-contour, quality, cost, overlap, and validation evidence
- retaining recurring target development friction in a compact, privacy-
  bounded project evidence index without promoting it directly into framework
  policy
- selecting target AI infrastructure by stable item ID and loading only its
  canonical source, permissions, gates, validation, and output contract
- using an installed adapter for post-install blueprint creation, drift review,
  framework update recheck, and adapter maturity review
- separating required core from optional modules so targets do not carry
  unused Alatyr surfaces as mandatory process
- separating workspace identity, artifact relationship, and current task mode;
  keeping accepted modes user-owned and preventing mode selection from granting
  approval, write scope, permissions, authority, or gate bypass
- bounding installed-operation requests by allowed actions before editing files
- keeping current user authorization independent from allowed actions,
  protected approval, tool permission, routing, assignment, mode selection,
  delegation, and structural validation
- routing clear requests automatically through a target operation catalog and
  checked compact exact-alias index,
  showing bounded help before guessing on ambiguity, keeping adapter health
  read-only, and previewing risk-gated changes before edits
- suggesting framework or documentation improvements when the process becomes
  hard to manage
- assessing whether a project adapter is incomplete, minimal, usable, or mature
  enough for the requested task area
- recording framework lifecycle, upgrade, deprecation, and migration facts in
  an adapter-owned format

## Machine-Checkable Expectations

Machine checks can verify only deterministic repository facts, such as:

- required source files and template files exist
- indexes reference required framework files
- templates remain placeholder-based before installation
- bridge files stay short and point to canonical target files
- target profiles route every framework document somewhere
- enabled optional modules have dependency, minimum-pack, rule, required-file,
  and deterministic-check closure against the installed capability catalog
- optional Debug Mode records can be checked for explicit activation metadata,
  non-canonical authority, versioned actor/causality/intervention/contribution
  attribution, event ordering, causal attribution, structured
  architectural impacts, direction-changing hypothesis replacement, lifecycle-
  bounded timing, immutable completion and continuation references, metric
  derivation, privacy declarations, typed evidence-event roles, complete
  materiality evaluation, registry-backed canonical skip references, claim-
  validation fidelity, exact durable engineering-evidence decision and
  reference resolution, structured validation evidence classes, index
  synchronization, Git object type, ancestry, binding state and lineage,
  repository lifecycle state and optional Debug/Git reconciliation,
  active-versus-finalized comparison boundaries, and clean-upstream policy
- target context routers match the profile template and route known framework
  documents somewhere
- recursive framework, project, and assistant context indexes can be checked
  for acyclic single-parent traversal, bounded depth, unique content coverage,
  current word estimates and digests, resolvable semantic references, and
  agreement with live router and manifest paths
- semantic-codebook shards can be checked for immutable term identity,
  dependency closure, exact-reference selection, digest and preload agreement,
  installed canonical-owner content binding, and deterministic packet
  projection
- static and installed bootstrap/profile paths can be measured against total,
  portable framework, and project-owned target-context budgets
- generated bootstrap projections can be checked through lazy integrity
  evidence against canonical source hashes, routed gate fragments can be
  checked for exact profile-default coverage, optional
  validator work can be dispatched from declared capability state, and source
  checks can be selected from explicit changed-path triggers
- a deterministic source walking skeleton can prove scaffold, Git-diff
  approval scope, placeholder-free core acceptance, blocking baseline drift,
  and post-update structural acceptance without claiming assistant execution or
  project semantic correctness
- target validation can distinguish non-accepting migration staging from strict
  acceptance, bind current-state evidence to the checked-out branch/revision,
  scan live surfaces required by enabled capabilities, and reject disagreement
  between manifest-enabled modules and their human module-profile state
- Debug Mode and durable engineering-evidence policy indexes can be checked
  against their human policy projections so resolved machine metadata cannot
  coexist with stale placeholder or contradictory README claims
- supported bridge templates expose the same compact bootstrap, operation
  catalog, single entry, health, help, and operation-routing entry points
- reviewed cost or speed improvements count as useful evidence only when
  accepted outcomes, hallucinated commands, validation errors, missed
  companion updates, rework, and unresolved consistency gaps do not regress
- schema-versioned effectiveness reports can require evidence-qualified human
  attention, review-cycle, and classified-intervention measurements; require
  executor active time to be observed or unavailable; and reject incompatible
  value and evidence-state combinations
- delayed-outcome records can require backward links, append-only lineage, and
  a declaration that completed source records were not modified, while
  adapter-maintenance records can require the six bounded maintenance metrics
  and their evidence states
- normalized context receipts distinguish planned and resolved source estimates
  from observed host/provider telemetry, and reject exact context or token
  claims when that observed evidence is partial or unavailable
- schema-versioned assistant capability records separate assistant surface,
  model provider, cache mode, exposed controls, exposed telemetry, retention,
  and minimum cacheable input; checks reject caching as a correctness or
  context-window requirement
- provider-neutral conformance execution records prepare, invocation or manual
  import, collection, and validation separately, while post-install/update
  delivery evidence records `sent`, `skipped`, or `blocked`; neither static
  fixture nor message-template presence proves an assistant run or user delivery
- manifest, operation catalog, approval, prompt-injection, help, and policy
  templates contain required fields
- target action-authorization policy, request, preview, gate, and final-evidence
  surfaces expose the required phase and current-scope contract
- explicitly selected machine-readable approvals can be checked so the
  complete Git changed-path set is allowed, not excluded, and bound to the
  selected diff base
- explicitly selected change packages can be checked for record shape,
  resolvable revisions, plan hashes, declared semantic and path scope,
  companion decisions, correction impact, and evidence-quality prerequisites
- target support policy and state can be checked for complete classification,
  ignored-file exclusion, case collisions, canonical digests, and current
  managed-surface coverage
- support/product diff reports can measure changed product files, changed
  support files, changed line counts, and support-to-product ratios without
  treating overhead as proof of quality or waste by itself
- consistency-map shards, reverse indexes, relationship lifecycle state, and
  bounded traversal limits can be checked structurally without treating the
  graph as proof of architectural correctness
- optional support-generation registries can be checked for unique producers,
  acyclic dependencies, stale inputs or outputs, guarded execution mode, and a
  repository-bound plan digest
- durable engineering-evidence indexes and selected records can be checked for
  shape, identity, task and repository binding, invariant and regression
  evidence, Git object type, ancestry, binding state and lineage, historical
  snapshot drift, index synchronization, publication policy, and prohibited
  raw conversation or secret-bearing fields

Machine checks do not prove the assistant understood the target project or
that project facts are correct. Prepared prompts and static bridge checks also
do not prove a vendor actually auto-loaded instructions or stayed within a
runtime context budget.

Machine checks do not prove that reported human attention was continuous, that
manually recorded or estimated timing is exact, that a declared delayed
external outcome occurred, or that an earlier completed record was never
mutated. Those claims require the named telemetry, repository history, or
external evidence. Measurement fields do not by themselves prove productivity
or cost savings.

Machine checks also cannot prove that an assistant interpreted conversational
intent correctly or that the newest chat message authorized an action. They
can require a common policy, conformance scenarios, and evidence fields so the
boundary is visible and reviewable across supported assistant surfaces.

Machine-readable validator output can make adapter evidence cheaper to reuse in
CI, assistant rechecks, or final reports, but it remains structural evidence.
It does not decide source-of-truth correctness or replace logical integrity
review.

Support hashes and generated impact closures likewise do not prove what a
changed fact means, whether a newly observed dependency is architecturally
valid, or whether the selected repair set preserves every invariant. Those
remain project reasoning and decision-owner responsibilities.

Project-knowledge checks can validate promotion linkage, route selectors,
authority/freshness states, canonical-owner digests, reciprocal conflict or
supersession links, packet limits, and shared constraints across assistant
surfaces. They cannot decide whether a promoted statement is true or whether
the named human authority should accept it.

`git-range` and `pull-request` package evidence can support a strong historical
claim about a complete reviewable change set. `selected-file-snapshot` is
bounded evidence only, and `unverified` supports no completeness claim.

Classify evidence before making a claim:

- `current-state` records what can be observed in the repository now
- `historical-record` records a dated operation, approval, validation run, or
  migration event with its source and repository revision when available
- `mixed` combines current-state observations with named historical records

The presence of a file in the current tree does not prove who created it,
which installer or assistant action ran, whether approval preceded the change,
or whether historical validation passed. Mark those claims unverifiable unless
dated records provide the evidence.

## Target-Dependent Guarantees

An installed adapter can provide stronger guarantees only when the target
defines:

- source-of-truth registry entries for relevant fact types
- architecture owner, decision authority, compact catalog, item-state evidence,
  validation, and revision policy when architecture knowledge is enabled
- consistency-map nodes and relationship coverage when the target uses bounded
  impact traversal
- task context profiles
- context router or equivalent machine-readable profile map when cheaper
  startup is expected
- recursive contour context indexes, semantic-codebook binding, and context-
  packet evidence when compact indexed routing is enabled
- module profile for required core and optional capabilities
- durable engineering-evidence owner, storage/publication policy, compact
  index, and retained record access for material tasks
- project-knowledge owner and decision authority, reviewed promotion records,
  registered canonical owners, compact route shards, freshness policy,
  two-stage routing, packet limits, and retained decision access
- project validation or explicit manual review
- approval rules and approval records when durable evidence is needed
- adapter output contracts for installation, framework update, and recheck
  evidence when the target wants durable operation records
- bridge capability matrix and selected-provider context-caching evidence for
  supported assistants
- task-specific maturity and blocking criteria
- migration notes for framework upgrades
- prompt-injection and source-access policies for imported AI infrastructure
- structured team policy, local attribution boundary, coordination backend
  contract, lazy active-work overlay, maintained per-task records or projection,
  concurrency control, and review policy when team collaboration is enabled

## Required Project Adapter

The framework can only provide useful process commitments when the project adapter
defines:

- project source-of-truth files
- project contours
- blueprint-equivalent source-of-truth docs and product-change workflow owners
- project-specific flows, prompts, gates, and skills
- project validation commands or manual validation checks
- project-specific test levels, tools, commands, fixtures, and isolation rules
- project-specific context map and source-of-truth documents
- project-specific context router or equivalent profile map when the adapter
  uses one for startup routing
- source-of-truth registry or equivalent owner map when multiple project
  surfaces can claim ownership
- project-specific risk/approval rules that extend the framework risk model
- project-specific security, live-service, dependency, destructive-operation,
  privacy, and credential-handling policies
- project-specific diagram source format, visual artifact format, render or
  manual-review policy, discussion presentation capability, ASCII baseline,
  and drift checks when diagrams exist
- project-specific framework baseline, local deviations, maturity gaps, and
  upgrade notes
- supported assistant bridge files, bridge capability matrix, and selected
  provider/client caching evidence when multiple assistant surfaces are
  supported; unknown or unsupported caching must fall back to bounded routing
- AI infrastructure inventory, recommendation, source access, provenance,
  adaptation, wrapper, and approval rules when skills or third-party assistant
  infrastructure are used
- target development-evidence owner, retention/privacy policy, and lazy capture
  flow when recommendations should learn across project tasks
- AI infrastructure router and adaptation-record policy when multiple skills,
  prompts, gates, checkers, tools, MCP configs, bridges, or wrappers are used
- installed-operation request, blueprint-creation, adapter-recheck, and
  framework-update review flows when the target wants post-install operations
- allowed-action meanings for installed-operation requests
- adapter output contract templates for installation, framework update, and
  recheck evidence when durable operation records are expected
- operation packet, storage policy, workstream boundaries, and checkpoint
  evidence when large or resumable operations are expected
- delegation policy, target role catalog/prompts, task and normalized-result
  contracts, per-surface runtime/native-definition evidence, bounded
  role/model bindings, packet scope, write isolation, retry/conflict fallback,
  validation, privacy, and primary convergence when worker execution is expected
- change-package record, retention policy, semantic scope, companion decisions,
  and provenance policy when coherent material-change evidence is expected
- target actors, local identity mapping, authority, priorities, task source,
  backend capabilities, synchronization, concurrency, storage, privacy,
  conflict, and review rules when team collaboration is enabled
- target workspace-mode identity, accepted definitions, relationship evidence,
  shared root support, per-mode context, selection policy, ambiguity behavior,
  and user decision records when workspace modes are enabled
- operation catalog, single entry, automatic routing, read-only health,
  risk-gated preview, help, and post-install/update chat-message templates when
  the target wants discoverable assistant requests
- task-specific maturity profile and blocking criteria
- module profile for required core gaps and optional module states
- migration-note template or equivalent upgrade evidence when framework
  updates are expected
- consistency checks that are deterministic for the project
- final evidence expected for that project

## Does Not Guarantee

The framework does not guarantee:

- correctness of project facts that are missing, stale, or contradictory
- that captured engineering evidence is automatically accepted, promoted, or
  delivered as current project authority
- that an assistant can infer business policy without programmer input
- that a client can launch subagents, select a requested model, report the
  actual model, or improve latency, quality, or cost through delegation
- that local commands exist in another project
- that generated files can be produced without the target repository tooling
- that architecture changes are safe without explicit approval and validation
- that observed implementation is an accepted or preferred architecture pattern
- that generated reference documentation, a successful generator run, or an
  assistant-written comment proves semantic correctness or supersedes a
  canonical project fact owner
- that a structurally valid vocabulary entry proves its definition, ownership,
  relationships, or acceptance are semantically correct
- that a valid recursive index proves an assistant loaded or understood a
  selected file, or that a valid semantic term proves the owning policy is
  semantically correct or applicable to the current task
- that structurally complete RED/GREEN records prove a test was executed,
  failed for the intended reason, or semantically proves the changed contract
- that a structurally valid extension package, catalog, lock, digest, path, or
  compatibility result proves source trustworthiness, license interpretation,
  semantic usefulness, runtime safety, or item correctness
- that a structurally valid dependency export, package-manager lock, artifact
  digest, publisher claim, normalized snapshot, or compatibility result proves
  semantic correctness, completeness, current applicability, client
  instruction precedence, or safe runtime behavior
- that unsupported assistants will auto-load the right files without a bridge
  or user instruction
- that missing security, live-service, or diagram policy can be inferred from
  another project
- that imported skills or third-party assistant infrastructure are safe,
  current, or compatible without target adapter review
- that "ask Alatyr" implies a runtime service, CLI, daemon, or universal
  command instead of an assistant using installed Markdown instructions
- that help wording or operation menus are current when the target adapter does
  not maintain them
- that a project adapter is mature enough for broad work unless its local
  facts support that claim
- that repository task records represent current external tracker state, or
  that task assignment, review, or a claim grants protected-change approval
- that a package validator can infer missing domain invariants, undeclared
  semantic effects, or accepted architecture from record structure
- that elapsed duration equals active human or executor work, that unavailable
  measurements equal zero, or that observed, manual, and estimated values are
  interchangeable
- that fewer review cycles or interventions prove better engineering quality
- that a delayed-outcome record proves an external acceptance, pull request,
  merge, rejection, regression, revert, or follow-up without its named evidence
- that effectiveness or maintenance measurements alone support a precise
  productivity ratio, percentage saving, or return-on-investment claim

## Failure Rule

If the framework cannot find current project facts, adapter gates, or approval
evidence, the assistant must stop or report the missing adapter piece instead
of inventing behavior or claiming validation passed.
