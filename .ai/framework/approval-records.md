# Approval Records

Approval records bind protected changes to a specific plan, scope, and
evidence trail.

They do not authorize an assistant to start implementation, commit, publish,
or perform a live external action. Current user authorization for those phases
is owned separately by `ALATYR-AUTHORIZATION-001`; both gates must pass when
both apply.

They are required when a target adapter needs durable evidence for an approval,
when approval scope covers multiple files or protected categories, or when a
plan may be reused after review.

## When To Use

Use an approval record for:

- architecture changes
- accepted business behavior changes
- destructive, live-service, data-loss, spend-affecting, or production actions
- new production dependencies or external services
- permission, credential, authentication, authorization, privacy, or security
  changes
- importing third-party assistant infrastructure into canonical target files
- overwriting existing AI instructions
- weakening tests, gates, approval rules, validation, or final evidence

Simple chat approval can be enough only when the target adapter explicitly
allows it and the protected change is narrow, immediate, and unambiguous.

## Minimum Record

An approval record should include:

- approval ID
- operation ID
- plan version
- plan hash or content hash when available
- approved plan file or recorded reason when a file is unavailable
- approved diff base when approval is bound to a repository comparison
- patch hash when an exact proposed diff is approved and deterministic hashing
  is practical
- allowed protected changes
- allowed changed-fact IDs, architecture areas, and behavior categories when
  semantic scope is material
- excluded semantic effects and permitted external effects when applicable
- allowed files or surfaces
- excluded files or surfaces, including an explicit `none` when applicable
- excluded actions
- approval source or message reference
- approved by
- approved at
- repository revision at approval when available
- whether reuse is allowed
- scope invalidation rule
- evidence of whether the final patch still matches the approved scope
- use result, result evidence, validation, and residual risk

If the plan changes after approval, the assistant must treat the approval as
stale for any changed protected scope.

For a change package, approval is stale when implementation introduces a
protected changed fact, architecture area, behavior category, external effect,
or path outside the approved scope. Path approval never grants undeclared
semantic scope.

An approval record is `historical-record` evidence. Keep allowed and excluded
files in explicit list fields so a checker can compare them with an actual
diff. A path mentioned only in narrative text does not place it inside the
approved scope.

For deterministic enforcement, use a machine-readable approval record with a
schema version, record kind, approved diff base, target-relative allowed and
excluded path lists, invalidation rule, and approval identity. Markdown may
remain the human explanation surface, but it must not be the only source used
for a strict `changed paths subset of approved scope` check.

Strict scope validation should:

- use only approval records explicitly selected for the operation, not every
  historical record in the approval directory
- verify that each selected record is bound to the requested Git diff base
- include committed, staged, unstaged, renamed, deleted, and untracked paths
- fail when any changed path is outside the union of allowed scopes
- fail when any changed path matches an excluded scope
- report unavailable Git or record evidence instead of treating it as a pass

Repository health checks may audit every stored approval as historical archive
evidence for parseability, required fields, safe target-relative scope, result
declarations, and verifiable plan references. That archive audit must remain
separate from current-operation enforcement: an unselected historical record
must never authorize, constrain, or be compared with the current operation
diff.

The source target-adapter validator enters strict scope mode automatically
when a caller supplies both a diff base and one or more explicit approval
records. A caller that supplies only a diff base receives advisory protected-
surface review because no operation-specific approval was selected.

The source helper `tools/alatyr.py approval-check --target <target-repo>
--diff-ref <base-ref> --approval-record <record.json>` is the compact
read-only route for this strict check when the AlatyrCore source tools are
available.

When semantic scope fields are present, deterministic validation should also
compare declared actual fact IDs, areas, behavior categories, and external
effects with the approved lists. This detects declared scope drift; it does
not infer undeclared effects or replace logical integrity review.

The strict comparison covers the complete operation diff, including code,
tests, docs, diagrams, adapter files, and approval evidence. Protected-change
classification decides whether approval is required; once a scoped approval is
used, companion files do not silently fall outside that scope.

## Repository Storage

Installed adapters should reserve a target-owned approval directory, commonly:

```text
.ai/assistant/approvals/
```

Approval records are target adapter evidence, not portable framework core.
The target may choose whether committed records are allowed, redacted, or
stored outside the repository.

## Hash Guidance

When a deterministic hash is practical, hash the approved plan text or the
validator's canonical Git change-set payload. The canonical payload binds one
resolved merge base, committed changes through the observed HEAD, staged and
unstaged layers, changed paths, and content digests for untracked files. The
same payload must own both approval-scope paths and content identity. If
hashing is not practical, record the exact plan version and the reason hash
evidence is unavailable.

When an installed adapter uses a validator, it may verify the recorded plan
hash against an approved plan file and the legacy-named `patch_sha256` field
against the canonical Git change-set payload for the recorded diff base.
New records must declare `canonical-git-change-set-v1` as the patch hash
contract. A validator must not silently compare a legacy or unknown hash under
the canonical contract.
If either hash cannot be verified, final evidence should say why rather than
claiming cryptographic approval binding.

Approved plan file references used for hash verification should be
target-relative paths. Do not point approval records at arbitrary absolute
local paths.

Do not include secrets in approval records or hash inputs that must remain
private.

Content hashes and path-scope validation are different controls. A scope check
does not prove content approval. A hash implementation that omits committed,
index, worktree, or untracked layers does not prove the complete selected
change set. Report the exact contract that was verified.

## Final Evidence

When an approval record was used, final evidence should name:

- approval ID
- protected categories covered
- files or surfaces changed under approval
- whether the implementation stayed within scope
- whether declared semantic scope stayed within the approved fact, area,
  behavior, and external-effect boundaries
- whether the approval remained valid after plan, patch, or scope changes
- validation run or skipped
- result or evidence reference
- residual risk
