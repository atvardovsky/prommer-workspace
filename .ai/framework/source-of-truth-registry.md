# Source Of Truth Registry

A source-of-truth registry maps fact types to canonical owners and derived
surfaces.

It prevents assistants from choosing owners by convenience, file proximity, or
recency when project evidence conflicts.

## Purpose

The registry should answer:

- which file or surface owns a fact type
- which files are derived from that owner
- which direction synchronization should flow
- which stable fact ID, consistency level, and project area identify the owner
- which machine-map node routes to related contracts and surfaces
- which invariants constrain scope, identity, ownership, lifecycle, and
  dependent behavior when the fact changes
- which validation or manual review confirms consistency
- who decides when two canonical-looking sources disagree

Do not define one global precedence order for all facts. API contracts,
database schemas, ADRs, tests, public docs, runtime config, and assistant
policy can each have different owners.

## Registry Entry Contract

Each entry should define:

- fact type
- canonical owner
- stable fact ID, consistency level, and project area
- consistency-map node or an explicit missing relationship record
- relationship coverage and known gaps
- invariant and dependency constraints that must be re-derived during change
- derived surfaces
- sync direction
- validation or manual review
- conflict resolver
- approval trigger when changing the canonical owner
- final evidence expected after a change

If a target does not know the owner for a fact type, mark it as missing instead
of inferring ownership from the nearest file.

## Machine-Readable Relationship Companion

Large repositories may enable a machine-readable consistency map. The human
registry remains canonical for ownership and conflict explanation. The map
provides compact changed-fact routing to contracts, project areas,
implementations, tests, docs, diagrams, generated artifacts, and assistant
governance.

Use stable fact IDs to connect registry entries to map nodes. When the module
is enabled, every live registry entry must name one resolved map node, that
node's `fact_type` must match the registry Fact Type exactly, and no two
registry entries may claim the same node. The map may contain additional
contract, area, system, or adapter nodes that do not own registry facts.

A missing or stale relationship remains an adapter gap; it does not justify
scanning every project surface or inventing an accepted edge. Deterministic
detectors and assistants may record an evidence-bound relationship candidate,
but the candidate remains non-authoritative until the target decision owner
accepts it and updates the owning registry or graph surface. Update the human
registry, machine map, consistency-routing descriptor, measured semantic
context scenario, and generated bootstrap evidence as one reviewed adapter
change. Deterministic tooling may validate or regenerate derived routing and
bootstrap surfaces, but it must not infer canonical owners or relationship
accepted edges.

## Common Fact Types

Target adapters may include fact types such as:

- product behavior
- business rule
- public API contract
- internal service contract
- architecture decision
- architecture pattern or architectural item
- data model
- migration
- runtime configuration
- security policy
- validation command
- diagram source
- generated documentation
- structured code-comment contract
- code-documentation profile and generator policy
- project vocabulary term, alias, acronym, and acceptance state
- vocabulary-to-data-dictionary link
- test strategy and accepted test-first policy
- assistant operation
- structured team policy, actor identity mapping, authority, or priority policy
- skill, prompt, wrapper, or bridge behavior
- approval rule
- external dependency public contract
- target dependency configuration, restriction, wrapper, or patch deviation
- cross-package integration contract
- accepted Project Development Model guidance and its reviewed-discovery or
  verified direct decision-owner record

The target adapter decides the actual names and owners.

Project-guidance route entries are derived lookup surfaces, not fact owners.
Register the canonical owner and conflict resolver for every accepted fact,
then use the route entry only to find and reverify that owner. A promotion or
direct decision-owner record preserves origin, authority, scope, and
disposition but does not acquire canonical authority. Narrowing and exception
precedence remains fact-type-specific and target-owned.

Dependency exports are external claims, not automatically target-owned facts.
When dependency knowledge is enabled, register the applicable ownership split:
the package owner controls its declared public guarantee, the target controls
local use and deviation, and a named integration owner controls cross-package
behavior. Record trust, freshness, authority, and applicability separately;
do not encode them as one precedence value.

Workspace identity, accepted development modes, default selection, and
artifact relationships are target-owned project facts when workspace modes are
enabled. Register their decision authority and evidence. Mode descriptors may
link to architecture, package, skeleton, ownership, or validation sources but
must not replace those owners. A selected mode routes context; it does not
become source of truth for the facts it references.

## Baseline Template Entries

The target registry template should include baseline entries for fact types
that commonly create drift when left ownerless:

- product behavior
- business rule
- architecture decision
- data model
- validation command
- security policy
- assistant operation
- AI infrastructure item
- team policy when team collaboration is enabled
- code documentation profile when code-documentation generation is enabled
- project vocabulary when terminology support is enabled
- test strategy and test-first policy when that optional module is enabled

Each baseline entry may remain placeholder-based during installation planning,
but before an adapter claims maturity the owner should be resolved from target
evidence or explicitly marked missing.

Generated reference documentation is a derived surface. A target may assign
bounded symbol-level explanation to structured comments, but declarations,
registered API specifications, business blueprints, architecture decisions,
security policy, data owners, and operational sources retain the fact types
assigned to them. A generator cannot change that ownership direction.

Accepted vocabulary records may own a scoped project term's meaning, aliases,
acronym expansion, and discouraged synonyms when the target assigns that fact
type to them. They remain links or derived explanations for business rules,
schemas, APIs, data fields, architecture decisions, security policy, code, and
operational facts owned elsewhere.

## Conflict Handling

When sources disagree:

1. Identify the fact type.
2. Read the registry entry for that fact type.
3. Name the canonical owner and derived surfaces.
4. When a consistency map is enabled, build the applicable relationship impact
   closure from the changed fact ID.
5. Re-derive the entry's invariant and dependency constraints. When the map is
   unavailable, use those constraints to build a compact manual closure.
6. If the owner or relationship coverage is missing or ambiguous, report the
   missing adapter fact.
7. Repair the smallest coherent set of selected relationship surfaces.
8. Record invariant results, selected and skipped edges, validation, and
   residual risk.

If the registry itself is wrong or stale, treat that as an adapter change. Do
not silently repair product facts by changing the registry unless approval is
present when required.
