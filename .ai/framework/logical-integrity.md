# AI Framework Logical Integrity Review

This file defines the portable logical integrity review used by Alatyr Core.

Logical integrity review is the step where an assistant decides what fact
changed, which source owns that fact, what else must change with it, and what
evidence proves the repository is coherent afterward.

Concrete source-of-truth files, validation commands, diagrams, prompts, skills,
and checker rules belong to the project adapter.

## Goals

Logical integrity review exists to prevent assistants from:

- changing behavior while leaving docs, tests, diagrams, prompts, or gates
  stale
- updating a generated or bridge artifact as if it were the source of truth
- treating a passing script as proof that no semantic fact changed
- hiding missing context behind confident implementation
- repairing drift in a broad or inconsistent way

## Semantic Change Decision

Before editing or finalizing a change, decide whether any semantic or logical
fact changed.

Facts include:

- business or domain rule
- use case, workflow, runtime flow, or state transition
- data structure, field, relation, format, key, retention rule, or persistence
  behavior
- module boundary, dependency direction, interface, port, message, or external
  contract
- security, privacy, permission, credential, destructive-operation, live-service,
  or dependency behavior
- test expectation, validation gate, checker invariant, prompt rule, skill
  instruction, bridge rule, or documentation-sync rule
- code-documentation profile, structured comment contract, generator,
  generated-output policy, or publication boundary
- project vocabulary term ID, scoped meaning, alias, acronym, deprecated
  wording, related term, or data-dictionary link
- test-first policy state, trigger, mode, command, isolation, exception, or
  RED/GREEN/refactor evidence contract
- diagram edge, actor, state, container, object relation, sequence, or generated
  artifact ownership rule

If no semantic or logical fact changed, final evidence should explain why no
companion update was required.

## Review Steps

Use this sequence when a fact may have changed:

1. State the change intent in concrete language.
2. List changed facts, not only changed files.
3. Classify each changed fact by risk using the framework risk model and the
   target adapter.
4. Identify the source of truth for each fact, using the target
   source-of-truth registry when it exists.
5. Compare code, tests, docs, diagrams, prompts, skills, bridge files, gates,
   generated artifacts, and checker rules that mention the fact.
6. Name conflicts and missing context explicitly.
7. Decide synchronization direction from the registry or owning contour.
8. Re-derive the invariants that connect the changed fact to its scope,
   identity, ownership, lifecycle, and dependent contracts. State each
   invariant in testable language before choosing a repair.
9. Choose the smallest coherent repair set that preserves those invariants.
10. Apply required companion updates or explain why none are needed.
11. Run target validation that exists, or record manual/unresolved checks.
12. Apply the durable engineering-evidence capture decision. For a material
    task, preserve compact invariant, root-cause, solution, regression, and
    repository-binding evidence when reusable knowledge would otherwise be
    lost; otherwise state a fact-specific skip or block reason.
13. Report final evidence and residual risk.

When test-first development is activated, the repair set must include the
selected policy trigger, changed fact or invariant, valid expected RED,
same-contract GREEN, refactor state, broader validation, and any accepted
exception. These records support but do not replace semantic review.

When work begins from review comments, defect reports, or a list of requested
fixes, do not process each item as an isolated file edit. Cluster items by
changed fact and contract, identify shared invariants and boundaries, and run
one combined impact review over the proposed repair set. A local edit that
satisfies one comment but leaves the shared invariant false must be revised.

When no consistency map is enabled, invariant re-derivation remains mandatory.
Use canonical owners, data and identity scope, architecture boundaries,
callers, persistence behavior, and tests to construct a compact manual impact
closure. Record missing relationship knowledge as residual risk instead of
claiming that the optional map was unnecessary.

When a target consistency map exists, replace broad surface comparison with a
bounded impact closure: start from changed fact IDs, select applicable
relationship edges, traverse dependent contracts only when they can propagate
the change, and record skipped or missing edges. The map routes review; the
human source-of-truth registry still owns ownership decisions.

Start that closure from the target support diff and reverse relationship index
when they are current. Treat hashes as change-location evidence only. Re-derive
the semantic fact and invariant before accepting the routed repair set. If a
code or support change exposes a new relationship, record a candidate for the
target decision owner; do not traverse it as accepted architecture until that
owner accepts it.

For multi-workstream operations, perform local review within each workstream
and one global review over the combined repair set before completion. The
global review reconciles shared facts, canonical owners, approvals,
cross-workstream contracts, and generated artifacts.

When a change package is active, reconcile its declared actual fact IDs,
areas, behavior categories, companion decisions, and implementation
corrections with this review. The package organizes evidence; it does not
replace invariant derivation or impact closure.

## Source-Of-Truth Decision

When files disagree, choose the owner by contour:

- framework rule: portable AI process under `.ai/framework`
- project fact: target product, code, business, data, runtime, security, or
  operation fact under the project contour
- repository adapter fact: local assistant workflow, validation, gate, prompt,
  skill, bridge, checker, or evidence rule
- generated artifact: output whose source must be named by the adapter
- bridge file: short pointer to canonical target files

If the target adapter has a source-of-truth registry, use the registry to
resolve fact type ownership before falling back to contour-level ownership.

Do not choose the source of truth by convenience, recency, or file proximity.
If the owner is missing or unclear, report the missing adapter fact before
claiming the repository is consistent.

## Repair Direction

Repair the smallest coherent set of files that restores the accepted contract.

Typical companion updates may include:

- project source-of-truth docs or blueprint-equivalent docs
- runtime flow or use-case docs
- code and tests
- diagrams and generated visual artifacts
- prompt, skill, gate, bridge, or checker rules
- public docs or maintainer docs

Do not hide architecture, business, security, or approval changes inside
documentation-only, diagram-only, prompt-only, or generated-file-only edits.

## Evidence Format

A logical integrity review should be reportable as:

```text
Change intent: <requested or inferred change>
Changed facts: <concrete facts>
Re-derived invariants: <testable scope, identity, ownership, lifecycle, and dependency statements>
Review-item reconciliation: <clusters, shared contracts, and combined repair decision>
Risk class: <framework and adapter risk>
Source of truth: <owning file or missing adapter fact>
Conflicts found: <what disagreed, if anything>
Repair set: <files or artifacts updated>
Impact closure: <selected/skipped edges, levels, areas, and missing links>
Validation: <target commands or manual checks>
Approvals: <used or not required>
Residual risk: <skipped or unresolved checks>
```

The project adapter may require a stricter format.

## Rejection Criteria

Reject or revise work that:

- changes a logical fact without naming it
- handles related review items independently without re-deriving their shared
  invariant or reviewing the combined repair set
- treats generated, bridge, or copied text as canonical without checking its
  owner
- updates only one surface when code, docs, tests, diagrams, prompts, skills,
  gates, or bridges also own the changed fact
- weakens tests, gates, approvals, documentation-sync rules, or checker rules
  to make a change pass
- claims validation passed without target evidence
- copies another repository's facts into framework core
