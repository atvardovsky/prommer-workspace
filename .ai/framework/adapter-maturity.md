# AI Framework Adapter Maturity

This file helps an assistant judge whether a project adapter is ready to
support reliable AI work.

It is not a scorecard for project quality. It is a readiness model for the
framework.

Adapters should report maturity by task area when possible. A target can be
mature for documentation work, usable for ordinary code changes, minimal for
data work, and incomplete for security-sensitive work at the same time.

## Levels

### Incomplete

The adapter is incomplete when it lacks one or more of:

- canonical assistant entry point
- project, framework, and repository adapter contour separation
- project source-of-truth docs
- validation plan or explicit unresolved validation
- final evidence expectations

Assistant behavior is high-risk. The assistant should avoid broad changes and
report missing adapter facts.

### Minimal

The adapter is minimal when it defines:

- entry point and contours
- basic project facts
- basic validation commands or manual checks
- documentation-sync rule
- basic source-of-truth or blueprint-equivalent owner
- bridge files for the assistants in use

The assistant can handle small tasks, but should report missing tests,
diagrams, security, maturity, or checker coverage when relevant.

### Usable

The adapter is usable when it also defines:

- architecture/source-of-truth docs
- use cases or equivalent workflows when applicable
- test strategy and validation gates
- security and live-service boundaries
- diagram policy when diagrams exist
- approval triggers
- logical integrity review path
- blueprint-driven change or equivalent product-change workflow
- installed-operation request and adapter-recheck path for post-install work
- operation catalog, automatic routing, read-only health, risk-gated preview,
  and bounded help for ambiguous requests
- AI infrastructure inventory, evidence-based recommendation, source access,
  adaptation, and provenance rules when skills or third-party assistant
  infrastructure exist

The assistant can perform ordinary implementation and documentation tasks with
focused validation.

### Mature

The adapter is mature when it also defines:

- context packs or navigation aids for broad work
- target-owned fact IDs and relationship coverage for bounded impact traversal
  when the repository has many project areas or competing surfaces
- module ownership, data dictionary, glossary, and decision log
- deterministic consistency checks for maintainable invariants
- generated-artifact drift checks or manual-review policy
- framework upgrade/lifecycle notes
- post-install operation, blueprint repair, and framework-update recheck notes
- maintained help menu and post-install/update chat-message templates
- AI infrastructure inventory and add/adapt/remove recommendations
- project-contour and outcome evidence for recommendations that add new items
  or improve, consolidate, replace, retire, or keep existing items
- target-owned development-pattern evidence with bounded references,
  retention/privacy policy, and no direct framework mutation
- AI infrastructure item routing, permission/gate/output contracts, and
  adaptation records when multiple items exist
- skill/wrapper compatibility notes for supported assistants
- improvement advice path for reducing future friction

The assistant can handle larger tasks with phased context loading and stronger
evidence.

## Task-Specific Maturity

When judging a request, report maturity for the task area before relying on a
single overall level.

Common task areas:

- documentation
- code changes
- architecture
- data
- security
- AI infrastructure
- framework upgrade
- team collaboration

Each task area should name:

- maturity level
- supported work
- required context
- required owners
- required validation or manual review
- approval needs
- blocking criteria
- residual risks
- final evidence expectations

The target maturity profile template should include baseline entries for:

- documentation
- code-changes
- architecture
- data
- security
- ai-infrastructure
- framework-upgrade

Do not use a numeric score as the main maturity result. Numbers can create
false precision when the real issue is a missing owner, policy, or validation
surface.

## Blocking Criteria

Use blocking criteria for high-risk task areas:

- security-sensitive work is blocked without security owner, credential
  policy, validation, and approval rules
- data work is blocked without data owner, migration or rollback policy,
  validation, and destructive-change approval rules when applicable
- AI infrastructure integration is blocked without inventory, source access,
  prompt-injection policy, provenance, permissions, and approval rules
- framework upgrade work is blocked without manifest, installation note,
  context profiles, module profile, bridge references, operation catalog,
  health/recheck flows, and operation help
- team coordination is blocked when the optional module is enabled without a
  target operating-model owner, actor and authority evidence, canonical task
  source, synchronization direction, storage/privacy policy, maintained
  registry or projection, overlap policy, and review validation

If a task is blocked, report the missing adapter facts and suggest the smallest
adapter repair before attempting broad product changes.

## Adapter Audit Questions

Ask:

- Can an assistant find the mandatory context without user explanation?
- Are framework rules, project facts, and adapter rules separated?
- Are local commands and generated artifacts clearly adapter-owned?
- Are tests and validation discoverable?
- Are security and live external side effects bounded?
- Are approval-required changes named?
- Can scoped approvals be bound to a diff base and checked against every
  changed path through explicitly selected machine-readable records?
- Do logical reviews re-derive invariants and reconcile related review items
  when no consistency map supplies the relationship closure?
- Are docs, diagrams, prompts, skills, bridges, and checker rules synchronized?
- Can the adapter be rechecked after installation or framework update without
  relying on user memory?
- Can an assistant show useful Alatyr help when the user's requested operation
  is unclear?
- Are existing AI infrastructure items inventoried before new items are added?
- Can recommendations distinguish project needs from assistant-contour item
  ownership, evaluate existing items first, and state quality and cost evidence?
- Can repeated development friction be retained without raw conversations and
  loaded only during capture, recommendation, recheck, or effectiveness review?
- Can an assistant select one AI infrastructure item without loading unrelated
  skills, prompts, gates, or tools?
- Are imported or custom AI infrastructure items adapted from target evidence
  with provenance and safety review?
- Is there a way to report missing or unresolved adapter facts?
- Is maturity reported for the requested task area, not only overall?
- Are blocking criteria defined for security, data, AI infrastructure, and
  framework upgrade work?
- Does the module profile distinguish required core gaps from optional modules
  that are enabled, deferred, disabled, not applicable, or blocked?
- For broad work, can changed facts be routed to affected contracts and areas
  without scanning the entire repository, or is that limitation reported?
- For team work, can the adapter identify current actors, claims, changed-fact
  overlap, handoffs, reviewers, and revision-bound evidence without loading
  unrelated history?

## Rejection Criteria

Reject maturity claims that:

- ignore missing validation or source-of-truth docs
- treat scripts as a substitute for assistant reasoning
- count bridge files as canonical policy
- copy another project's adapter facts instead of writing target facts
- hide unknowns instead of reporting residual risk
- claim overall maturity while the requested task area is blocked
