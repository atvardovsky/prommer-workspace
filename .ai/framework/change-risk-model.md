# AI Framework Change Risk Model

This file defines a portable way to classify change risk before deciding tests,
docs, diagrams, approvals, and validation.

The risk model is framework core. Concrete gates and commands belong to the
project adapter.

## Risk Classes

Classify each changed fact, not only each changed file:

- Documentation-only: wording, index, or explanation that does not alter an
  accepted contract.
- Test-only: validation changes without production behavior changes.
- Business logic: formulas, thresholds, decisions, rule order, reasons,
  eligibility, permissions, or domain invariants.
- Architecture: module boundaries, dependencies, ownership, runtime
  responsibilities, data ownership, public interfaces, or deployment shape.
- Data and persistence: schema, migrations, indexes, keys, serialization,
  retention, money/time/id formats, or query behavior.
- External boundary: API, webhook, queue, file, shell command, email, payment,
  third-party service, or live side effect.
- Security and privacy: secrets, credentials, tokens, permissions, PII,
  redaction, audit, destructive operations, or dependency trust.
- Tooling and validation: package manager, CI, linter, formatter, checker,
  generated files, test framework, or assistant gate.
- AI governance: framework, adapter, prompt, skill, bridge, flow, checker, or
  documentation-sync rule.
- AI infrastructure adaptation: imported skill, prompt, wrapper, bridge, rule,
  assistant-native format, MCP/tool permission, output format, provenance, or
  third-party assistant infrastructure.

One change may belong to multiple classes. Use the highest-risk applicable
class for approval and evidence.

## Required Reasoning By Risk

For each risk class, decide:

- source of truth
- affected contracts
- required tests or manual validation
- documentation and diagram sync
- approval requirement
- rollback or repair direction
- final evidence needed
- whether target policy makes test-first work required, recommended, not
  indicated, or blocked

High-risk changes require explicit reasoning before relying on scripts.
Scripts are evidence for known contracts; they do not decide what changed.

## Approval Triggers

The framework treats these as protected categories:

- architecture changes
- accepted business-policy changes
- spend, money, billing, data loss, destructive operation, or live external
  side-effect changes
- weakened tests, gates, approval rules, or documentation-sync rules
- new production dependencies, services, permissions, or credentials
- third-party AI infrastructure integration into canonical files
- overwriting existing target assistant instructions during framework
  installation

The project adapter may add stricter approval triggers.

## Test And Documentation Impact

Use the risk class to choose companion work:

- business logic needs tests for edge cases and plain-language rationale
- architecture needs level or boundary documentation and approval evidence
- data changes need schema/data-contract docs and persistence validation
- external boundaries need contract fixtures, retry/failure/idempotency
  reasoning, no-live-call policy, and explicit failure-class observability when
  callers, operators, retries, or user-visible behavior must distinguish one
  failure reason from another; the target may use typed errors, result values,
  status codes, or another project-owned contract
- security changes need redaction, permission, and secret-handling checks
- AI governance changes need bridge, skill, prompt, gate, and consistency
  sync
- routed AI infrastructure changes need item permission, gate, validation,
  output-contract, provenance, and supported-assistant checks
- AI infrastructure adaptation needs inventory, provenance review, wrapper
  sync, safety review, target validation, and approval when protected assistant
  infrastructure or permissions change

When test-first development is enabled, use its target policy to select the
trigger and mode. When disabled or deferred, a reproducible defect, changed
invariant or contract, risky refactor, concurrency behavior, or recurring
regression may justify one concise enablement assessment; changed code alone
does not.

If no companion update is needed, final evidence must explain why no semantic
or logical fact changed.

## Rejection Criteria

Reject changes that:

- classify risk only by filename while ignoring changed facts
- lower risk to avoid tests, docs, diagrams, or approval
- weaken validation to make a patch pass
- change protected behavior without explicit approval
- treat a script pass as proof that no logical impact exists
