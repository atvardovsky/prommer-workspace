# Rule Registry

This file is generated from `framework/rule-registry.json`. Edit the JSON
registry and the canonical owner document, then run
`python3 tools/render_rule_registry_docs.py`.

Rule IDs let target adapters and migration records reference stable process
contracts without copying complete policy text. In this source repository,
canonical semantics remain in the `canonical_source` owner named by each
registry entry. The installed owner is its deterministic `.ai/framework/`
projection in a target adapter. Category routing owners group related rules
but do not replace those semantic owners.
`framework/rule-ownership.md` renders both mappings from this registry for
maintainers and tools; it is not an independent policy source.

## Registry Entries

Rule ID: `ALATYR-CONTEXT-001`
Source owner: `framework/context-profiles.md`
Installed owner: `.ai/framework/context-profiles.md`
Commitment: Use the smallest task profile through an aligned context router.
Keep routine bootstrap compact; bind it to canonical sources through lazy
integrity evidence and reserve the entry packet for recovery, audit, or
conflict. Follow only selected recursive-index branches. Resolve schema-2
semantic terms by exact reference and dependency closure, verify their
canonical-owner digests, emit required term and owner-rule obligations in
schema-3 packets, and fail closed to canonical prose. Compose eager gates
exactly from profile defaults and load conditional policy only on its trigger.
Keep stable reusable guidance before volatile task state, but treat provider
caching as optional and claim savings only from observed telemetry. Use changed
support state and accepted relationships for bounded impact routing without
treating hashes or candidates as authority. Record selector reasons, omissions,
expansion, packet identity, context budgets, and honest planned, resolved, or
observed evidence. Never skip required owner, approval, safety, integrity, or
validation context to meet a budget.
Applies to: all installed adapter tasks.
Enforcement: required.

Rule ID: `ALATYR-SOURCE-001`
Source owner: `framework/source-of-truth-registry.md`

invariant and dependency constraints, require every live registry Fact Type to
reference one unique exact-matching node when consistency mapping is enabled,
keep detected relationships non-authoritative until target owner acceptance,
keep Project Development Model guidance routes and decision records derived
from registered owners with fact-type-specific exception authority, preserve
bounded code-comment ownership, generated-output boundaries, vocabulary links,
target test-strategy ownership, and target team-policy versus
coordination-record ownership, and otherwise use contour ownership plus manual
invariant closure while reporting missing coverage.

Enforcement: required.

Rule ID: `ALATYR-RISK-001`
Source owner: `framework/change-risk-model.md`
Installed owner: `.ai/framework/change-risk-model.md`

approval, validation, documentation, diagram, observable external failure
distinctions, test-first recommendation, and evidence scope.
Applies to: all changes.
Enforcement: required.

Rule ID: `ALATYR-APPROVAL-001`
Source owner: `framework/approval-records.md`
Installed owner: `.ai/framework/approval-records.md`
Commitment: Require explicit approval for protected changes, keep that approval
distinct from current-scope action authorization, use explicitly selected
machine-readable records to enforce that the complete operation diff stays
within approved path scope, and reconcile activated package facts, architecture
areas, behavior categories, external effects, and paths with declared semantic
scope.
Applies to: protected changes, installed operations.
Enforcement: required.

Rule ID: `ALATYR-AUTHORIZATION-001`
Source owner: `framework/action-authorization.md`
Installed owner: `.ai/framework/action-authorization.md`
Commitment: Bind inspect, modify, commit, publish, and live-external phases to
explicit current-scope user intent; default subject switches, backlog returns,
reports, discussion, analysis, and ambiguous continuation to read-only; expire
authorization when scope completes or changes; and keep allowed actions,
protected approval, tool permission, routing, assignment, modes, delegation,
and validator success from granting a missing phase.

live external actions.
Enforcement: required.

Rule ID: `ALATYR-SAFETY-001`
Source owner: `framework/security-safety-guidance.md`

broaden permissions unless the target adapter allows it and approval is present
when required.
Applies to: security-sensitive work.
Enforcement: required.

Rule ID: `ALATYR-SAFETY-002`
Source owner: `framework/prompt-injection.md`
Installed owner: `.ai/framework/prompt-injection.md`

Source owner: `framework/logical-integrity.md`
Installed owner: `.ai/framework/logical-integrity.md`
Commitment: Name changed facts, re-derive testable invariants, reconcile
related review items, identify owners and repair sets, validate, decide
proportional durable engineering-evidence capture, and report residual risk,
using support-state changes plus bounded accepted relationships or manual
impact closure without treating hashes or inferred relationships as semantic
proof, global multi-workstream convergence, active package scope, selected

keep supporting implementation and validation events separate from materiality;
evaluate supported capture conditions explicitly; capture compact project-owned
task, invariant, hypothesis outcome, root-cause, solution, regression,
validation, publication, and uncertainty evidence when triggered, with

creating a second source of truth: accept either reviewed engineering
discoveries or verified direct decision-owner directives, require accepted
facts to update registered canonical owners, classify guidance kind and origin,
model target-authorized narrowing and exceptions without a global precedence
order, expose mapped, known-gap, and unknown coverage without fake
completeness, classify module adoption as enabled-empty, populated, or
reuse-observed without inventing reuse evidence, keep a compact derived sharded
index with independent authority and freshness states, and deliver only
accepted current items through bounded initial and refined task routes.

or session, record compact non-canonical events that separate human, executor,
Alatyr-system, external-maintainer, and automation roles from actor identity
and provider/product/model/runtime provenance; classify interventions and
independently discovered knowledge candidates without conflating executor work
with human correction; keep completed records immutable and continue related
work through newly activated acyclic lineage; preserve versions 1 through 4
without inventing missing attribution or lifecycle evidence; enforce phase
versus full-task coverage, candidate disposition closure, reciprocal
durable-evidence links, lifecycle-bounded event time, direction-change
causality, materiality, validation fidelity, result binding, privacy,

Installed owner: `.ai/framework/extensions.md`
Commitment: Treat an external Alatyr extension, including a provider-backed
collaboration integration, as a declarative untrusted package until read-only
inspection, immutable provenance, compatibility, license, permissions, target

relationships, and task mode separate; let assistants propose evidence-bound
modes but require user-owned acceptance; store shared root context and every
actual mode in bounded project directories; select one accepted mode before
task routing; ask on ambiguity; and never let a mode activate nested adapters
or grant approval, write scope, permissions, authority, tools, or gate bypass.

Source owner: `framework/module-profile.md`
Installed owner: `.ai/framework/module-profile.md`
Commitment: Establish the required core profile, including current-scope action
authorization, proportional durable engineering evidence, and current support
policy/state, before optional modules; separate directly selected capabilities,
dependency-closed staged structure, and target-validated enabled state so
scaffolding never implies activation; select a compatible framework pack;
preserve existing target-owned shared surfaces for their declared adapter-aware
merge strategy, retain shared output while producers or preservation policy
require it, and record create/retain/merge/remove outcomes; rebuild optional
relationship and generation indexes before support state; and enforce
optional-module dependency, operation, rule, required-file,

automatically through a canonical target operation catalog and checked compact
exact-alias index, bind common help, status, discussion, change, backlog,
update, commit, and publish request shapes to provider-neutral static protocol
expectations, enforce current-scope action phases independently of routing and
allowed-action mode, expose bounded support-diff/impact review and guarded
optional support generation alongside lazy durable engineering-evidence and
Debug Mode operations, compose bounded capability-gated delegation, provide

fact, canonical owner, contract, area, dependency, validation, and
support-surface impact; assign exactly one implementation level, bounded
context, allowed actions, validation, dependencies, and primary-or-worker
executor decision per task; keep small work as one local task when sufficient;
keep worker expansion inside a primary-owned bounded tree with coverage and
stop evidence; escalate only on named risk or relationship triggers; and keep
semantic decisions, approval, protected phases, integration, and final

reasons, scoped retries, and primary convergence for target-verified native
workers, external dispatchers, and suggestion-only handoff; allow workers to
propose but never autonomously dispatch child packets; keep provider-native
definitions as thin target bindings; preserve context, action, tool, write,
privacy, validation, model, runtime-capability, and concurrency boundaries; and
fall back without unsupported quality, latency, or cost claims.

fallback, freshness, limitations, and conformance evidence; keep assistant
surface separate from provider, preserve bounded routing when caching is
unavailable, and reject unsupported cache-hit, savings, or context-reduction
claims; use a provider-neutral prepare/invoke-or-manual-import/collect/validate
evidence lifecycle without representing static or manual fixtures as vendor
execution, and route selected AI infrastructure items plus enabled project,

installed framework pack, baseline, deviations, migration notes, and hash-bound
upgrade impact; bind releases to v<VERSION>, shipped schemas, contract-tree
evidence, and the checked-out target branch/revision; compare historical schema
and template trees from exact reachable source-version evidence when available
and otherwise report them as not compared; publish upgrade-assessment outputs
transactionally; preserve target-owned support classifications, relationships,

## Use In Target Adapters

Target adapters may reference rule IDs in migration notes, approval
records, recheck reports, module profiles, bridge capability records,
checker rules, and local deviations. Record the affected rule ID whenever
a target adapter intentionally narrows a portable rule.
