# Module Profile

Module profiles keep Alatyr Core from treating every capability as mandatory
for every target repository.

The framework has a minimal `kernel` support profile, a richer `core` support
profile, and optional modules. A target adapter records which modules are
selected, staged, enabled, deferred, disabled, or not applicable from target
evidence.

The installed `capabilities.json` catalog is the machine-readable owner for
optional-module dependencies, minimum framework packs, required target files,
module kind, rule IDs, and deterministic check IDs. Human module profiles
explain target state and evidence; they must not redefine that closure
independently.

Module kind keeps the catalog from mixing user-facing product support with
internal support plumbing:

- `project-facing`: directly helps developers understand, discuss, change, or
  validate the target project.
- `assistant-infrastructure`: adapts AI assistant surfaces, external
  infrastructure, or bounded worker delegation.
- `governance-support`: supports approvals, evidence, lifecycle, metrics,
  scaffolding, or other control-plane behavior.
- `source-repository`: provides optional maintenance tooling for the AlatyrCore
  source repository and is not projected as a target-project capability.

Scaffolding may begin with no optional modules and add an explicit dependency
closure through selected capability IDs. The target validator should dispatch
deep optional checks only for enabled modules or explicit module evidence.
Universal manifest, contour, routing, safety, framework-drift, and final-
evidence checks remain independent of optional module selection.

## Kernel And Core Profiles

Every accepted installation should provide the `kernel` support profile:

- contour separation for framework, project, and repository adapter facts
- adapter manifest with framework version, adapter schema version, template
  version, owner, supported assistants, known gaps, and local deviations
- adapter ownership metadata with responsible owner, backup owner, review
  cadence, last review date, and CODEOWNERS or equivalent file-owner map when
  supported
- context profiles with explicit task classification, a generated hash-bound
  bootstrap index, task-specific expansion rules, routed gate fragments, a
  compact router, and selected lazy profile descriptors
- source-of-truth registry or explicit missing owner records for important
  fact types
- change-risk classification and approval triggers
- current-scope action authorization that separates inspection, working-tree
  modification, local Git mutation, publication, and live external effects;
  expires prior-scope authorization; and does not infer one phase from another
- logical integrity review for changed semantic or logical facts
- validation or manual-review evidence, including unresolved checks
- final evidence format
- support-information policy, canonical cross-platform state, changed-surface
  evidence, and bounded impact routing that never replaces semantic review

The `core` support profile adds:

- durable engineering-evidence capture decision, compact index, target storage
  policy, and record validation for material tasks
- project-knowledge candidate or registered decision-owner guidance intake,
  promotion review, canonical-owner update, explicit exception and precedence
  evidence, compact sharded routing index, coverage states, two-stage bounded
  delivery, contradiction handling, retention, redaction, and reuse evidence

If any required item for the selected support profile is missing, the adapter
can still exist, but it must report the missing item as a gap before claiming
maturity.

## Optional Modules

Optional modules are enabled only when the target repository needs and can
maintain them:

Capability state is explicit and ordered:

- `selected`: capabilities requested directly for this installation or update
- `staged`: the dependency-closed set whose placeholder surfaces were
  scaffolded but are not yet adapted, validated, or active
- `enabled`: adapted capabilities accepted by the target with resolved facts,
  profile state, and required validation
- `deferred` or `blocked`: capabilities intentionally left inactive with a
  target-owned reason

Scaffolding must write selected capabilities and their dependency closure to
`modules.selected` and `modules.staged`, while leaving `modules.enabled` empty.
Installation or update work may move a capability from staged to enabled only
after its target facts, dependencies, operation routes, required files, and
checks pass. Merely copying a module's files never enables it.

- `blueprint-change`: blueprint-driven product-change workflow and project
  blueprint creation or repair.
- `consistency-map`: machine-readable changed-fact relationships and bounded
  impact closure for targets with many project areas or competing surfaces.
- `architecture-knowledge`: project-owned architecture index and compact
  catalog, pattern and area records, evidence-based architecture discussion,
  alternative comparison, review, documentation maintenance, and accepted
  decision handoff.
- `code-documentation`: project-owned documentation catalog and multiple
  source-set profiles for evidence-backed comment-style proposals, structured
  comment maintenance, target-specific deterministic generation, and derived
  output validation without loading all code documentation by default.
- `project-vocabulary`: project-owned compact terminology catalog, scoped term
  records, aliases, acronyms, ambiguity states, and links to canonical data or
  project facts without loading the complete vocabulary by default.
- `test-first-development`: target-owned test-first policy, bounded
  recommendation triggers, explicit enablement, RED/GREEN/refactor evidence,
  justified exceptions, and a project-adapted execution skill.
- `extensions`: declarative external assistant-infrastructure packages with
  read-only inspection, target normalization, compact catalog, immutable
  source and installed-file lock, permissions, lifecycle evidence, safe update,
  and ownership-aware removal.
- `dependency-knowledge`: passive package-owned public knowledge exports,
  exact artifact binding, target-owned trust/freshness/authority/applicability
  projection, bounded graph synchronization, deviations, retention, lazy
  explanation, and impact routing without activating nested adapters.
- `workspace-modes`: user-owned workspace identity, accepted development modes,
  explicit framework/application/library/skeleton/dependency relationships,
  optional shared root context, one directory per mode, evidence-based
  installation suggestions, bounded selection, and pre-change mode evidence.
- `diagrams`: diagram source, visual artifact, render or manual-review, drift,
  discussion presentation, generated capability index, per-assistant
  capability/freshness records, captured result conformance, security/privacy,
  stable revision lineage, portable ASCII layout/width, and optional rich
  presentation policy.
- `assistant-runtime-capabilities`: the compact assistant capability index and
  bridge matrix shared by diagrams, AI infrastructure, multi-assistant bridges,
  and worker delegation.
- `ai-infrastructure`: inventory, source access, prompt-injection handling,
  evidence-based recommendations, routed skill/prompt/gate/checker/tool/MCP/
  bridge selection, target development-pattern evidence and lazy capture,
  adaptation records, wrappers, permissions, output contracts, and provenance.
- `multi-assistant-bridges`: bridge capability matrix and assistant-specific
  wrappers for explicitly selected assistants. It depends on
  `assistant-runtime-capabilities` and `installed-operations` so every selected
  bridge has a closed operation and help route.
- `installed-operations`: post-install operation requests, machine-readable
  catalog, single entry, automatic routing, read-only health, risk-gated
  preview, adapter recheck, help, and chat-message templates.
- `large-task-orchestration`: task-scale routing, operation packets,
  workstreams, resumable checkpoints, and final convergence evidence for
  repositories that need large or multi-session changes.
- `subagent-delegation`: capability-gated decomposition into bounded,
  independently verifiable tasks, target-owned worker roles/prompts and
  assistant role/model/native bindings, deterministic readiness, normalized
  results, bounded primary-owned delegation trees, explicit stop reasons,
  disjoint writes, retry/conflict fallbacks, and primary convergence. It
  depends on `assistant-runtime-capabilities` and `installed-operations`;
  external dispatchers and additional assistant bridges remain separate
  optional capabilities.
- `change-packages`: coherent material-change evidence with semantic approval
  scope, companion-surface decisions, implementation corrections, compact
  architecture discussion, and before-to-after repository provenance.
- `team-collaboration`: target-owned actor and priority model, shared work
  registry, advisory claims, changed-fact overlap review, checkpoints,
  handoffs, decisions, team review, and revision-bound merge readiness for
  concurrent human and assistant work.
- `durable-approvals`: human and machine-readable approval-record storage plus
  strict diff-base/path-scope enforcement for protected changes that need plan,
  scope, or file evidence.
- `migration-diff`: human migration notes, framework baseline comparisons, and
  a machine-readable delta-first upgrade impact router.
- `effectiveness-metrics`: comparable task reporting for measuring framework
  usefulness.
- `debug-mode`: explicitly activated task/session observability with compact
  origin-attributed events, timing and capture-quality evidence, event-derived
  human-supervision metrics, structured architectural impacts, causal
  hypothesis replacement for direction changes, exact durable engineering-
  evidence references, completed-record comparison, clean-upstream projection,
  and non-canonical storage. It depends on `effectiveness-metrics` and
  `installed-operations`.
- `support-generation`: dependency-ordered target support artifacts with
  deterministic-derived, assistant-proposed, and owner-maintained modes;
  guarded staged apply; validation; and stale-output evidence.
- `scaffolding`: optional source-repository scaffolding helpers used only to
  create placeholder structure.

Targets may add local modules when they record the owner, enabled state,
required files, validation, and residual risk.

The manifest and human module profile are one projected contract. Every module
listed in `modules.enabled` must have exactly one matching profile block in
`enabled` or `required` state. A profile block in either state must be listed
in the manifest. Every module in `modules.staged` must have a `staged` profile
block and must not be described as active. Migration staging may expose
disagreement as repair work, but strict adapter acceptance must reject active
state drift. An accepted adapter must resolve or intentionally defer/disable
every staged capability; it must not retain a live `staged` claim.

## Shared Capability Surfaces

The machine capability catalog owns lifecycle metadata for target paths
produced by more than one optional module. Each shared surface declares its
target-adapter ownership, producer modules, merge strategy, and
`preserve_on_disable` behavior.

Enablement projects the union of every enabled module's required paths.
Disabling one producer must not remove or replace a shared surface while
another producer remains enabled. A shared target-owned surface marked
`preserve_on_disable` also remains after its final producer is disabled until
an explicit, separately authorized cleanup verifies that no target facts,
assistant capability evidence, or other module output would be lost. Module
state changes are not file-deletion authorization.

Source scaffolding may create a missing shared surface, but must not overwrite
an existing target-owned shared surface, including when generic overwrite mode
is enabled. Existing shared content requires the declared adapter-aware merge
strategy and exact path authorization. Record whether each affected shared
surface was created, retained, merged, or left blocked.

## Module States

Use these states in target adapters:

- `staged`: selected structure exists but target adaptation, activation, or
  validation is incomplete; this state is never accepted as active.
- `required`: part of the selected required support profile, including
  `kernel` items and any required `core`, `standard`, or `full` additions.
- `enabled`: installed and maintained for the target.
- `deferred`: useful, but intentionally postponed with a recorded reason.
- `disabled`: not used by the target.
- `not-applicable`: irrelevant to the target's current shape.
- `blocked`: needed, but missing owner, policy, approval, or validation.

Do not hide missing adapter facts by marking a needed module as disabled.

Module state evidence must also stay explicit. An installed adapter should
record:

- the target manifest path that owns enabled modules and the selected support
  profile
- the installed capability catalog path that owns module-required surfaces
- the human module-profile path that explains state, owner, reason, approval,
  validation, and residual risk
- the checked result of manifest/module-profile agreement
- unknown, stale, or unverified module evidence before claiming maturity

An enabled module is not accepted merely because its files exist. Acceptance
requires manifest state, human profile state, required surfaces, validation
evidence, and residual risk to agree for the current target.

## Installation Use

During installation or update:

1. Establish the smallest support profile that can safely support the target's
   current use of Alatyr.
2. Select optional modules from target needs, not from source-repository
   availability.
3. Record directly requested modules, staged dependency closure, and module
   states in the target adapter manifest and module profile.
4. Select and record the `kernel`, `core`, `standard`, or `full` support
   profile, then create only the target templates needed for staged, enabled,
   or required modules. Keep staged modules inactive until adaptation passes.
5. Select a compatible `kernel`, `core`, `standard`, or `complete` framework pack. The
   pack controls installed portable files, while context routing controls what
   is loaded for a task. A smaller pack must never be used to claim support for
   a broader profile or enabled module.
6. Leave deferred, disabled, not-applicable, or blocked modules in evidence
   with the reason and next safe action.
7. Resolve shared surfaces from the complete enabled-module set. Apply the
   catalog merge strategy and retain any surface required by another enabled
   producer or marked `preserve_on_disable`.
8. Rebuild optional relationship and generation indexes, then generate the
   required support state last so acceptance represents the final adapter.

Optional modules must not add target project facts from guesses or from another
repository.

## Evidence

A module profile review should report:

```text
Core profile state: <complete/missing gaps>
Adapter ownership: <owner/cadence/CODEOWNERS or equivalent/gaps>
Framework pack: <kernel/core/standard/complete and expansion needs>
Enabled modules: <modules>
Deferred modules: <modules and reasons>
Blocked modules: <modules and missing owners/policies/validation>
Files created or skipped: <target adapter surfaces>
Validation: <target checks or manual review>
Residual risk: <unresolved module gaps>
```

## Rejection Criteria

Reject module-profile work that:

- treats optional modules as mandatory for every target
- claims a module is enabled without owner, context, validation, and evidence
- enables test-first development without an accepted target policy, concrete
  commands, isolation rules, trigger modes, exception handling, and RED/GREEN
  evidence requirements
- enables extensions without immutable provenance, license and compatibility
  review, resolved target bindings, permission and approval evidence, exact
  installed-file ownership, lock validation, and safe removal behavior
- enables dependency knowledge without native-metadata-only discovery, exact
  artifact identity, untrusted-source handling, independent semantic state
  axes, target ownership, bounded graph traversal, retention policy, lazy
  routing, and structural validation
- enables workspace modes without user-owned acceptance, explicit workspace
  identity, one active root adapter, relationship/ownership evidence, one
  directory per actual mode, ambiguity handling, lazy context, preflight, and
  structural validation
- enables team collaboration without a coordination backend, actor and
  decision-owner evidence, storage/privacy policy, or conflict review
- enables subagent delegation without a target policy, current per-surface
  capability evidence, bounded role catalog/model/native bindings, task and
  result contracts, write isolation, validation, retry/conflict fallback, and
  primary-agent convergence
- enables Debug Mode without explicit per-scope activation, target-owned
  privacy/retention/publication policy, non-canonical authority, causal event
  attribution that separates executor, Alatyr-system, automation, actor
  identity, and runtime provenance, correction-disposition evidence,
  event-derived metric validation, bounded context, and expiry
- enables a consistency map without target-owned fact IDs, relationship
  coverage, or staleness handling
- enables architecture knowledge without a project owner, compact catalog,
  evidence revision, status separation, selected-source routing, and
  validation or manual review
- enables diagrams without portable ASCII presentation, source/visual
  ownership, compact assistant capability evidence, security/privacy policy,
  revision lineage, and render or manual-review evidence
- copies source-repository helper behavior into target requirements
- installs bridge, diagram, skill, or operation-help surfaces the target does
  not use
- removes a shared capability surface because one producer was disabled while
  another producer still requires it, or treats module disablement as cleanup
  authorization
- hides blocked core gaps behind a broad maturity claim
