# Blueprint-Driven Change Flow

Use this flow when a requested change may affect prommer.net workspace accepted
behavior, source-of-truth docs, implementation, tests, diagrams, or assistant
governance.

## Target Sources

- Project source of truth: `.ai/project/product-context.md` and the supplied codebase
- Blueprint or equivalent docs: not established; create only from concrete requirements
- Project flow guidance: `.ai/project/delivery-policy.md`
- Test strategy and validation: discover from the supplied codebase; currently manual review
- Diagram policy: `.ai/assistant/flows/diagram-discussion.flow.md`
- Security, privacy, and external actions: `.ai/project/privacy-policy.md`

## Steps

1. State change intent and non-goals.
2. Use `.ai/assistant/context-router.json` to load the smallest matching
   profile and project-area overlays plus the target source-of-truth docs.
   Activate the `large-or-resumable` scale overlay when its conditions apply.
3. Apply `.ai/assistant/flows/logical-integrity-review.flow.md`.
4. List changed fact IDs and canonical owners, re-derive testable invariants,
   and cluster related review items by shared fact or contract. When the `consistency-map`
   module is enabled, resolve exact registry-to-node identity from
   `.ai/project/source-of-truth-registry.md` and
   `.ai/project/consistency-map.json`, then derive affected contracts, areas,
   and surfaces and record selected/skipped edges.
5. Update target blueprint or equivalent source-of-truth docs when accepted
   facts change.
6. Update project flow, use-case, data, runtime, architecture, or public docs
   when those facts change.
7. Prepare an implementation plan that names affected boundaries, tests,
   contract artifacts, diagrams, visual validation, approvals,
   machine-readable scope records, and validation.
   Apply `.ai/assistant/flows/change-package.flow.md` when coherent material
   outcome, semantic multi-surface approval, audit, or publishable provenance
   needs pass its activation gate.
8. Evaluate the target test-first recommendation gate. When an enabled required
   trigger applies, or a recommendation is accepted, run
   `.ai/assistant/flows/test-first-change.flow.md` and preserve valid
   RED/GREEN/refactor evidence before completing implementation. Otherwise
   record why test-first was not indicated or was declined when material.
9. Apply `.ai/assistant/gates/contract-artifacts.md` when the changed fact
   crosses API, data, event, generated-reference, public-interface,
   persistence, or external-boundary contracts.
10. Change remaining code, tests, contract artifacts, diagrams, prompts,
    skills, bridge files, gates, or checker rules as required by the accepted
    fact change.
11. Apply `.ai/assistant/gates/visual-validation.md` when UI, layout,
    accessibility-relevant, rendered diagram, visual artifact, or discussion
    diagram presentation facts changed.
12. Run target validation that exists. Do not invent commands.
13. When relevant tooling exists, record support/product change cost for mixed
    support and product changes; treat it as structural cost evidence, not
    semantic proof.
14. When approval was used, compare the complete Git change set with the
    explicitly selected machine-readable approval scope and fail on uncovered
    or excluded paths.
15. Perform a final consistency check across changed surfaces and related
    review-item clusters.
16. Apply `.ai/assistant/gates/engineering-evidence.md` and preserve compact
    reusable task knowledge when triggered and authorized, or record a
    fact-specific skip or blocker.
17. Report final evidence, skipped checks, approvals, and residual risk.

For large or resumable changes, use
`.ai/assistant/flows/large-task-orchestration.flow.md` and maintain one packet
from `.ai/assistant/templates/large-task-operation-packet.md`. Complete one
global logical integrity review after workstream-local validation.

## Approval Gate

Require explicit programmer approval before:

- architecture changes
- accepted business behavior changes
- weakened tests, gates, documentation-sync rules, or approval requirements
- new production dependencies, services, permissions, or credentials
- live, destructive, spend-affecting, data-loss, security, or privacy changes
- overwriting existing AI instructions
- integrating third-party assistant infrastructure into canonical target files

## Final Evidence

Report:

- changed facts
- re-derived invariants and reconciled review-item clusters
- relationship impact closure, missing links, and areas reached
- source-of-truth or blueprint updates
- implementation, test, contract-artifact, diagram, prompt, skill, gate,
  bridge, or checker updates
- validation run or unresolved
- support/product change cost when measured
- contract artifact review result when applicable
- visual validation result when applicable
- test-first policy result, RED/GREEN/refactor evidence, accepted exception, or
  reason not indicated when the recommendation gate was materially evaluated
- approvals used
- changed-path approval scope enforcement result
- skipped checks and residual risk
- for large tasks, workstream convergence, context receipts, and checkpoints
- for activated change packages, semantic and path scope, companion decisions,
  material corrections, provenance quality, and public claim strength
- durable engineering-evidence status, record ID/path and repository binding,
  or a fact-specific skip or blocker
