# Diagram Discussion Flow

Use this flow when a programmer asks to see, sketch, compare, explain, or
iteratively revise a diagram during an assistant discussion.

## Required Context

- Diagram rule: `.ai/framework/diagram-guidance.md`
- Module state: `modules` in `.ai/alatyr.yaml`; load
  `.ai/assistant/module-profile.md` only for missing, conflicting, or repair
  evidence
- Presentation contract: `.ai/assistant/templates/diagram-presentation.md`
- Current assistant entry in `.ai/assistant/assistant-capabilities.json`
- Selected surface state and diagram capability:
  `.ai/assistant/assistant-capabilities/codex.json`
- Diagram owner or policy: `.ai/project/privacy-policy.md` and this flow
- Relevant fact owners: `.ai/project/product-context.md`, the supplied codebase,
  and `.ai/project/source-of-truth-registry.md`

Load source-of-truth, risk, integrity, approval, security, privacy, or
product-change context only when the requested view proposes or exposes a fact
change, contains sensitive data, invokes an external renderer, or persists an
artifact.

Load `.ai/framework/ascii-diagrams.md` for dense, quantitative, or ambiguous
layouts. Load `.ai/assistant/templates/ascii-diagram.md` when persisting or
reusing an ASCII diagram. Simple discussion diagrams use the bounded rules in
this flow and the presentation contract without those extra files.

Unknown, stale, expired, unsupported, or unverified surface state still permits
the portable ASCII baseline, but it does not permit a native rendering or
artifact-delivery claim.

## Allowed Actions

- `read-only`: present the diagram in chat and create no repository files.
- `docs-only`: persist target-owned diagram source and allowed derived visual
  artifacts with target-owned local tooling; do not use network renderers or
  change code, tests, runtime config, or accepted facts.

If the request needs broader actions, hand off to the matching decision,
documentation-sync, or product-change operation.

## Flow

1. Confirm the diagram purpose, scope, type, and whether it explains current
   facts, compares alternatives, or proposes a change.
2. Check that the `diagrams` module is enabled or required. If it is unavailable,
   report the module gap and offer a bounded textual explanation.
3. Read the canonical owners for only the facts in scope. Mark missing or
   conflicting evidence instead of filling it with plausible detail.
4. Classify the result as `draft`, `accepted-source`, or `derived-view`.
   Default to `draft` for discussion and alternatives.
5. Assign or retain a stable diagram ID. Start draft revision `1`, increment it
   for each revision, and name the superseded or parent revision. Do not reuse
   an ID for an unrelated scope.
6. Classify data sensitivity and required redactions. Neither allowed action
   invokes an external renderer. For local docs-only artifact generation,
   check target security, storage, retention, and sharing policy. Hand off any
   network action to an operation with sufficient actions and approval gates.
7. Build the portable ASCII view. Use a fenced
   `text` block, printable 7-bit ASCII, no tabs or color, a preferred width of
   88 columns, and a hard maximum of 100 columns. Split dense diagrams instead
   of crossing connectors or shrinking stable names.
8. Read only the current assistant surface record selected by the compact
   capability index. Verify route, enum values, client version, verification
   time, expiry, and evidence. Do not infer rich presentation support from
   another surface or stale claims.
9. Report `ascii` as the default presentation mode. Add `native-inline` for a
   recorded supported syntax or `rendered-artifact` from target-owned tooling
   only when useful and permitted. Both richer modes supplement the ASCII view;
   they never replace it.
10. Under `read-only`, keep all draft content in the assistant response. Under
   `docs-only`, write only target-owned diagram source and allowed derived
   visual artifacts, then run the target render or manual-review process.
11. Apply `.ai/assistant/gates/visual-validation.md` when the diagram is
    persisted, rendered, promoted, used as evidence, or likely to be reused
    outside the transient chat response.
12. If discussion accepts a new business, architecture, data, runtime,
   security, or public-contract fact, stop treating the diagram as the change
   mechanism. Route the accepted fact to its owner and the applicable decision
   or product-change flow.
13. Present the result using the diagram presentation template. Include the
   ASCII block and its readability check even when a richer view is available.
14. Require repository revision and source revision or content hash for
    `accepted-source` and `derived-view`. Otherwise keep the result `draft`.
    Report validation, omitted detail, unresolved facts, and stale-view risk.

## Result

```text
Diagram purpose: <purpose and scope>
Diagram ID and revision: <stable ID, draft revision, parent/superseded revision>
Status: <draft, accepted-source, or derived-view>
Presentation mode: <ascii, native-inline, or rendered-artifact>
Capability: <surface, client version, verified at, evidence>
Source and revision: <inline, path, revision/hash, or none>
Visual artifact: <path, attachment, unsupported, or none>
ASCII view: <included, width, direction, and readability result>
Assumptions and unresolved facts: <items>
Security and external rendering: <classification, redactions, action, policy>
Validation or manual review: <result>
Visual validation: <evidence, skipped reason, or not applicable>
Next operation: <continue discussion, persist, decision, sync, or product change>
```

## Rejection Criteria

Reject or revise diagram discussion that:

- claims native rendering without current bridge capability evidence
- relies on missing, stale, or invalid capability enum evidence
- treats a draft or alternative as accepted project truth
- invents actors, states, dependencies, tables, APIs, or business rules
- creates files under `read-only`
- runs an unrecorded render command or writes generated artifacts outside the
  target diagram policy
- exposes restricted facts or uses an external renderer without policy and
  sufficient allowed actions and required approval
- marks a view accepted or derived without repository and source revision
  evidence
- loses diagram ID or draft lineage during iterative revision
- returns only source syntax while claiming a visible rendered result
- omits the ASCII diagram, exceeds 100 columns, or uses non-ASCII drawing
  characters, tabs, or color
- uses crossing connectors, ambiguous direction, or an unlabeled chart scale
- uses diagram edits to bypass approval or product-change requirements
