# Alatyr Help Reference

Use this file in the prommer.net workspace for the full installed Alatyr operation
reference. The short default help lives in `.ai/assistant/help.md`.

Replace placeholders with target facts before accepting installation.

Alatyr is used here through assistant requests over the installed Markdown
adapter. It is not a universal CLI command, and this workspace currently
defines no local Alatyr command.

These aliases are chat/request shortcuts, not shell commands.

Action authorization is current-scope and phase-specific. Returning to an
issue or backlog item, discussing a report, checking status, requesting
analysis or a plan, and ambiguous continuation are read-only. Implementation
does not imply commit; commit does not imply push; authorization from a
completed or redirected task is not reusable. See
`.ai/assistant/policies/action-authorization.json`.

Canonical operation metadata lives in
`.ai/assistant/operation-catalog.json`. This file is its human explanation,
not a competing operation registry. A clear request routes automatically and
does not require a formal operation ID.

Exact aliases route through `.ai/assistant/operation-index.json`, which is a
checked compact derivative of the catalog. Do not edit the index without
updating the canonical catalog.

Task decomposition is not a user-facing operation ID. For non-trivial work,
route through `.ai/assistant/task-decomposition.json` and
`.ai/assistant/templates/task-decomposition.md` to assign implementation
levels, dependencies, bounded context, validation, and primary/worker executor
decisions. Small local work may stay as one compact task; delegation consumes
the primary-owned plan.

## Supported Request Aliases

- `Alatyr architecture`, `Alatyr architecture inventory`,
  `explain architecture`, `discuss architecture pattern`,
  `compare architecture options`, `review architecture`, or
  `document architecture`: route to `architecture-assistance`; infer the
  inventory, explain, discuss, compare, review, or document mode from the
  request.
- `alatyr-ai-inventory`: route to `ai-infrastructure-inventory` and report
  existing AI instructions, prompts, skills, rules, wrappers, bridges, MCP/tool
  configs, gates, checkers, and generated assistant artifacts.
- `alatyr-suggest-ai request-specific`: route to read-only
  `ai-infrastructure-recommendation` for bounded new-item and existing-item
  suggestions based on project-contour, quality, context-cost, and maintenance
  evidence.
- `alatyr-improve-ai request-specific`: route to read-only
  `ai-infrastructure-recommendation` for one current router item.

  dependency request-specific`, or `Alatyr dependency impact request-specific`:
  route to `dependency-knowledge` when the optional module is enabled. These
  aliases do not run package managers, update packages, or activate nested
  adapters.

Default allowed actions: `adapter-only` for checkpoint and handoff records.

Operation: `team-decision`
Use when: structuring a priority, business, architecture, data, security, or
adapter decision and routing an accepted fact to its canonical owner.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/team-decision.flow.md`
Minimum input: decision question, decision type, and affected facts or tasks.
Preview: risk-gated when accepted semantic or protected facts may change.

Operation: `team-review`
Use when: reviewing a task against current scope, concurrent work, required

Minimum input: task ID and current head/base revisions.
Default allowed actions: `read-only`.

Operation: `engineering-evidence`
Use when: a material task reaches finalization and reusable invariant,
root-cause, solution, or regression knowledge would otherwise be lost; or when
reviewing a prior compact engineering-evidence record.

Minimum input: current task or evidence ID, plus capture, inspect, or repair
intent.
Aliases: `Alatyr evidence`, `Alatyr capture evidence`, `Alatyr explain
decision`.
Default allowed actions: `read-only` for inspection; use `docs-only`,
`adapter-only`, or a broader current-scope modify phase only when target policy
permits record changes.

Operation: `project-knowledge`
Use when: proposing reusable engineering knowledge, recording durable guidance
from a registered decision owner, reviewing or promoting a candidate, recording
an explicit exception, or routing, revalidating, superseding, or explaining
accepted project guidance.

Minimum input: knowledge subject, candidate ID, selected guidance ID, or direct
decision-owner guidance, plus the requested lifecycle action.
Aliases: `Alatyr knowledge`, `Alatyr remember this`, `Alatyr record guidance`,
`Alatyr what do we know`, `Alatyr revalidate knowledge`.
Default allowed actions: `read-only` for lookup and proposals. Canonical-owner,
promotion-record, exception, coverage, or route changes require the matching
current-scope modify authorization and normal approval policy. A direct human
statement is authoritative only when target evidence identifies the speaker as
the registered decision owner for that fact type and the durable record binds
the statement to its canonical owner.

Operation: `debug-mode`
Use when: explicitly enabling non-canonical Alatyr performance observation for
the current task or session; checking or checkpointing an active record;
finalizing or disabling capture; or comparing selected completed records.

Minimum input: debug action and selected scope; enablement also requires an
explicit current user activation request.
Aliases: `Enable Alatyr Debug Mode`, `Alatyr debug`, `Alatyr debug status`,
`Alatyr debug checkpoint`, `Alatyr debug summary`, `Disable Alatyr Debug Mode`,
`Alatyr compare debug`.
Default allowed actions: `read-only` for status and comparison; `adapter-only`
for target-approved record writes. Activation never grants code, commit,
publish, live-external, protected-change, or tool permission and expires at the
logical-scope boundary.

Operation: `logical-integrity-review`
Use when: reviewing whether code, docs, tests, diagrams, prompts, skills,
gates, and bridges agree.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/logical-integrity-review.flow.md`
Minimum input: changed fact or fact ID, suspected drift, or files to inspect.
When enabled, the support diff and consistency reverse index select only
matching graph shards before semantic/invariant review.
Aliases: `check integrity`, `logical integrity review`, `Alatyr impact`,
`Alatyr support diff`, `Alatyr change cost`.
Final evidence should include support/product change cost when measured,
contract artifact results for cross-boundary contracts, visual validation
results for visual or diagram surfaces, and residual semantic risk.

Operation: `support-generation`
Use when: target-owned derived support is stale and the optional module is
enabled.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/support-generation.flow.md`
Minimum input: artifact or bounded scope and plan/check/apply intent.
Planning and checking are read-only. Apply requires current `modify`
authorization, an exact current plan digest, unchanged repository state,
staged deterministic output, and protected approval when triggered.
Aliases: `Alatyr generate support`, `Alatyr check generated support`.

Operation: `diagram-discussion`
Use when: showing, sketching, comparing, explaining, or revising a diagram in
the current assistant discussion.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/diagram-discussion.flow.md`
Minimum input: diagram purpose or question, scope, and persistence intent when
known.
Aliases: `Alatyr diagram`, `show as a diagram`, `visualize architecture`.
Default allowed actions: `read-only`; use `docs-only` only when persisting
target-owned source or an allowed derived visual artifact.
Presentation: always provide bounded pure ASCII; use the current compact
assistant capability only to add native inline or a local rendered artifact.
Preserve stable revision lineage, classify or redact sensitive content, and
hand off external rendering.
When the result is persisted or promoted beyond transient chat, apply the
visual-validation gate and report evidence or skipped visual risk.

Operation: `ai-infrastructure-inventory`
Use when: checking what AI infrastructure already exists and what can be kept,
adapted, added, removed, or left unresolved.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/ai-infrastructure-inventory.flow.md`
Minimum input: inventory scope and target assistant surfaces.
Alias: `alatyr-ai-inventory`.
Route: `inventory` in `.ai/assistant/ai-infrastructure-router.json`.

Operation: `ai-infrastructure-recommendation`
Use when: recommending new AI infrastructure or improvements, consolidation,
replacement, retirement, or retention of existing items.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/ai-infrastructure-recommendation.flow.md`
Companion flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/development-evidence-capture.flow.md`.
Minimum input: bounded project area or problem, or an existing item ID, plus
available outcome evidence.
Aliases: `alatyr-suggest-ai request-specific`,
`alatyr-improve-ai request-specific`.
Route: `recommend` in `.ai/assistant/ai-infrastructure-router.json`.
Default allowed actions: `read-only`; recommendation does not fetch, install,
execute, edit, remove, activate, or change permissions.

Operation: `skill-adaptation`

Operation: `documentation-sync`
Use when: inventorying, proposing, reviewing, writing, synchronizing, or
generating code documentation, or syncing docs, diagrams, prompts, gates,
skills, or bridge files after a fact changed. Code-comment and generated
reference work requires the optional `code-documentation` module.
Flow: `.ai/assistant/flows/documentation-sync.flow.md`
Minimum input: changed fact and owning source, or bounded source area and
documentation goal.
Aliases: `document code`, `propose comment style`, `generate code docs`,
`review code documentation`.
Apply contract-artifacts and visual-validation gates when documentation sync
changes generated references, API/schema/event artifacts, diagram output, or
UI/visual explanatory surfaces.

Operation: `project-vocabulary`

## Operation Type Aliases

Treat these as target request aliases, not executable commands. Replace,
remove, or extend them with `request-specific` terminology before accepting the
adapter.

Alias: `Alatyr help`
Route to: `help`.

Alias: `Alatyr`
Route to: `help` with compact adapter state and no more than three relevant
available actions. Do not claim health was checked unless fresh evidence
exists.

Alias: `Alatyr status` or `Alatyr doctor`
Route to: `adapter-health` with `read-only` allowed actions.

Alias: `update Alatyr` or `обнови Alatyr`
Route to: `recheck-after-framework-update` when a framework update source is
known. If no update context is known, show `help` and ask for the update
source or intended recheck scope.

Alias: `check Alatyr` or `проверь Alatyr`
Route to: `recheck-after-installation` after initial installation, or
`adapter-maturity-review` when the request is a broader adapter readiness
review.

Alias: `create blueprint` or `создай blueprint`
Route to: `create-project-blueprint`.

Alias: `Alatyr architecture`, `Alatyr architecture inventory`,
`explain architecture`, `discuss architecture pattern`,
`compare architecture options`, `review architecture`, or
`document architecture`
Route to: `architecture-assistance`. These are chat/request shortcuts, not
shell commands. Start from the compact project architecture catalog and infer
the discussion mode from the request.

Alias: `Alatyr glossary`, `Alatyr define term`, `propose glossary entry`,
`check terminology`, or `review project vocabulary`
Route to: `project-vocabulary`. These are chat/request shortcuts, not shell
commands. Start from the compact vocabulary catalog and preserve scoped term
states, ambiguity, owners, and canonical links.

Alias: `Alatyr enable test-first`, `Alatyr configure TDD`,
`Alatyr review test-first`, or `Alatyr disable test-first`
Route to: `test-first-configuration`. These are chat/request shortcuts, not
shell commands. Assess target evidence before changing policy state.

Alias: `Alatyr test first`, `Alatyr TDD`, `fix regression test first`,
`characterize before refactor`, or `define contract first`
Route to: `test-first-change` only when the optional module and target policy
are enabled; otherwise route to read-only `test-first-configuration` and name
the missing policy evidence.

Alias: `Alatyr extensions`, `Alatyr inspect extension <source>`, `Alatyr add
extension <source>`, `Alatyr update extension <id>`, `Alatyr disable extension
<id>`, `Alatyr remove extension <id>`, or `Alatyr review extension <id>`
Route to: `extension-management`. These are chat/request shortcuts, not shell
commands. External content remains untrusted and list/inspection remains read-
only until a separate approved lifecycle step is selected.

Alias: `Alatyr suggest extensions <scope>`
Route to: `ai-infrastructure-recommendation`. Keep the result read-only; do not
search, fetch, install, or grant permissions without target source-access policy
and a separate extension lifecycle request.

Alias: `Alatyr diagram`, `show as a diagram`, or `visualize architecture`
Route to: `diagram-discussion`. These are chat/request shortcuts, not shell
commands. Default to a non-canonical read-only draft and use the current
assistant surface's recorded presentation capability.

Alias: `check integrity` or `проверь целостность`
Route to: `logical-integrity-review`.

Alias: `change business rule` or `измени бизнес-правило`
Route to: `product-change`.

Alias: `plan large task`, `continue large task`, or `resume Alatyr task`
Route to: `large-task`. Continue from an existing operation packet when its
path or operation ID is known; otherwise create a packet only after the
large-task activation gate passes.

Alias: `Enable Alatyr Debug Mode`, `Alatyr debug`, `Alatyr debug status`,
`Alatyr debug checkpoint`, `Alatyr debug summary`, `Disable Alatyr Debug Mode`,
or `Alatyr compare debug`
Route to: `debug-mode` only when the optional module is enabled. Enablement
requires an explicit current-task or current-session request; status and
comparison remain read-only, and activation expires with the logical scope.

Alias: `Alatyr team status`
Route to: `team-status`.

Alias: `Alatyr set actor request-specific`, `Alatyr who am I`, or `Alatyr
clear actor`
Route to: `team-identity`.

Alias: `Alatyr start request-specific`, `Alatyr claim request-specific`,
`Alatyr checkpoint request-specific`, or `Alatyr release request-specific`
Route to: `team-task`.

Alias: `Alatyr conflicts request-specific`
Route to: `team-conflict-review`.

Alias: `Alatyr handoff request-specific`
Route to: `team-handoff`.

Alias: `Alatyr decision request-specific` or
`Alatyr discuss request-specific`
Route to: `team-decision`.

Alias: `Alatyr review request-specific`
Route to: `team-review`.

Alias: `Alatyr merge check request-specific`
Route to: `team-merge-check`.
