# Durable Engineering Evidence Gate

Canonical owner: `ALATYR-ENGINEERING-EVIDENCE-001`.

Before completing a material semantic, architectural, or non-obvious repair,
ask whether reusable engineering knowledge would be lost after this session.

Capture when evidence shows an undocumented invariant, material rejected
hypothesis, non-obvious side effect, cross-area impact, invariant-driven broad
regression matrix, compatibility or architecture decision, reviewer
correction, or another reusable conclusion that is expensive to reconstruct.

Small self-explanatory changes may skip capture with a short fact-specific
reason. Do not activate a change package solely because this gate captures a
lightweight record.

When structured materiality is available, evaluate every condition as
applicable, not applicable, or unknown. Implementation and validation events
support the decision but do not independently force capture. Do not skip with
unknown materiality. Every applicable conclusion in a skipped decision must
resolve to an existing canonical source registered for the named project fact
type; a commit message, issue, test, or Debug record alone is not canonical
preservation.

For capture, require a task reference, repository result binding, invariant,
root cause, solution rationale, material alternatives when applicable,
regression rationale, validation, residual uncertainty, canonical-owner links,
and target storage policy. Store normalized conclusions only, never raw chat,
chain-of-thought, secrets, personal data, or unrelated session history.

Final bindings require the correct Git object type, immutable IDs, valid
commit ancestry where applicable, and `prior_bindings` lineage when a binding
is replaced. Later worktree drift does not invalidate a finalized historical
snapshot; report that it is no longer currently reproducible.

Schema-version-3 records list Debug session IDs when Debug Mode contributed to
the evidence. Require one-to-one resolution, reciprocal links, and shared task
lineage. Do not invent Debug links for historical schema versions.

Final evidence must report `durable_engineering_evidence` as `captured`,
`skipped`, or `blocked`, plus the record ID/path or a specific reason.
